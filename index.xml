      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many times I’ve started to write this post in my mind since May 2018. Today I’m finally typing it on the computer. This will be a rather long post that ties in several threads. I’ll talk about Cold Spring Harbor’s Biology of Genomes conference and its relationship to my undergrad in Mexico. I’ll also introduce you to Aldo Barrientos (198x-2011) who was was my undergrad classmate. Then I’ll tell you about myself and how regardless of your situation, privileged or not, you should ask for help and get to know the people around you. Finally, I want to highlight that many other Mexican researchers are doing great work and would love to be invited to talk about their work. Or simply, the opportunity to compete for scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;cshl-and-lcg-unam&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CSHL and LCG-UNAM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past May I was selected to give a talk at &lt;a href=&#34;http://meetings.cshl.edu/Genome18&#34;&gt;Biology of Genomes 2018&lt;/a&gt; (BOG) at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cshl.edu/&#34;&gt;Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (CSHL). This was my first time being there and I had plenty of time to reflect before my talk&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For me, attending BOG was like a dream come true so I was blown away when I was selected to present at BOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard about the BOG conference when I was studying my undergrad in Mexico at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/es/about&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;. My class has a history with the conference too. Basically, part of the class was meeting to discuss what optional courses to create for our fourth year, and well, some miscommunication happened among us. This created a rift in the group and was one of my motivations for focusing on communication as well as giving back. The former lead to me being elected as class president and the latter lead to me volunteering to teach R courses later on my undergrad&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As BOG18 went underway, some of my fellow junior presenters started their talks by mentioning why CSHL was special to them. Following their cue, I wrote some notes just before my presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/2018-11-06%2021.21.51.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to give a shoutout to all my LCG-UNAM classmates. I also thought of Aldo Barrientos and how it could have been him at BOG. This got me nervous, but I really wanted to do it. I also wanted this to be short and professional. You can see how it turned out for yourself&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRGkibDQgIc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;aldo-barrientos&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aldo Barrientos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time for me to tell you more about Aldo Barrientos, my LCG-UNAM classmate. I won’t attempt to tell you his whole story since I think that others could write a much more detailed one that myself. I hope they do and if they are made public, I’ll share them from this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldo came from a low income family in Mexico: I believe that his father was a farmer. He was smart and advanced through school successfully. He took the entry exam for LCG-UNAM like many people did in 2005. Eventually only around 10-15 percent of the applicants were admitted to this undergrad program. The school was free (25 Mexican cents per year), but it involved relocating to a new city. UNAM has some scholarship programs, but they are not enough. Aldo found a way like he always did. For example, he sold candy and juice to his classmates during lunch break. For reasons that I don’t remember, Aldo didn’t complete his undergrad in 2009 but was about to in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember Aldo as a very joyful person who was always smiling and joking with the rest of us. He had the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; dancing skills of anyone at my undergrad. He proved them time and time again, for example winning a dance contest at a party in my house and wearing the Pumas UNAM puma costume in our graduation party and dancing with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/goyo.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sk.pinterest.com/pin/170714642102216698/&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His path was cut abruptly in 2011. He was stabbed multiple times while waiting for someone. We all knew about this. It’s still unclear to me how everything happened in the following weeks. But I remember being told that he tried seeing a doctor before going back to his home. One day in 2011, we all started to learn about how grave his situation had turned. I didn’t know what to do&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I talked to David Romero, director (dean?) of CCG-UNAM back then. He guided me and others and we were trying to coordinate ways to help Aldo, but by the time we got to his home it was too late. I regret that we weren’t able to help Aldo earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have some emails from 2011 when we were talking about doing something to honour him. We never did as a class, though LCG-UNAM did acknowledge him. Maybe one day we will do an event to remember him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldo faced more challenges that myself and other classmates. Yet I believe that he would have kept solving them one by one; and had he chosen to stay in academia, then present his research findings at conferences like BOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;privileged-yes-entitled-no&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Privileged yes, entitled no&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about Aldo made reflect also on who has been around in my own path, who has helped me and how grateful I am to them. Undoubtedly I’ve had an easier path than others including Aldo. That is, I’ve been privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even with my privileged position it has been a hard fought battle to get to where I am now. I think that a mistake others do is that they assume that they are entitled to something given their privilege instead of working for that thing. This can apply to visas and the like where you still &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/19/problems-with-an-article-from-the-baltimore-sun-covering-dr-mahoney-steel-s-immigration-issues/&#34;&gt;have to apply for them in time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along my way I have hesitated many times what to do and have sought guidance from others. Also along my way, I’ve tried to get to know others in my surroundings. Now that I look back I realize that many people were at my position or in junior positions have kept working towards their career goals and advanced in them. So, if you can, get to know others and learn from them. They could be the future Full Professors with Tenure, future Senior Software Engineers or other titles you look up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an incomplete version of my timeline (&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/misc/timeline.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF version&lt;/a&gt;). I think that it’s pretty hard to list everyone who has helped you along the way. For example, I’m not mentioning my Ph.D. classmates from whom I learned many things. But it will give you a more detailed picture of the amount of people that have helped me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/timeline.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;invite-lcg-unam-alumni&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Invite LCG-UNAM alumni&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said at the beginning of my BOG18 talk, I’m not sure if I’m the first LCG-UNAM alumni to present at BOG but I know for sure that I won’t be the last one. That’s because I’m really proud of my classmates and all the great work they are doing. It’s also easy to go beyond my class to other LCG-UNAM alumni and then even go beyond and extend this to Mexican researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken from my timeline, here are a few that I mentioned there (links are to their Twitter profiles):&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steps for writing a Twitter summary conference blog post</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/10/23/steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/10/23/steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote several blog posts with many tweets&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a way of taking notes during the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ashg.org/2018meeting/&#34;&gt;American Society of Human Genetics 2018 conference&lt;/a&gt;. A few friends asked me how I did this &lt;em&gt;so fast&lt;/em&gt;. The process can be summarized into the following main steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save links of tweets you want to highlight in your post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-powered blog to obtain the code for embedding tweets easily&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proofread, edit and post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;my-steps-detailed&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My steps detailed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the actual process I used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify the conference Twitter hashtag. In my recent case, that was &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ASHG18&#34;&gt;ASHG18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a Google doc or some other simple text file you can access easily from your phone and laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in a presentation, check the &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt; tweets for the given hashtag. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;vertical=default&amp;amp;q=%23ASHG18&#34;&gt;ASGH18 example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2010.53.44%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the link of any tweet you find interesting. If there are none for the session you are in, consider writing some tweets yourself with the conference hashtag!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.12.23%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste the link into your Google doc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.10.53%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the day is over, copy-paste the contents of your Google doc into a text editor that has the ability to find and replace using regular expressions. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://macromates.com/&#34;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find and replace to create the syntax for embedding tweets. I’ll cover more of this in detail in the next section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://twitter.com/.*/status/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and replace by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\n`r blogdown::shortcode(&amp;quot;tweet&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\?s=[0-9]*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and replace by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;)`\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.17.58%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our file now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.18.07%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add any comments you wish, format the headings and proofread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it public and tweet about your post with the conference hashtag!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you are done! 🙌🏽🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;quick-embedding&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick embedding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that my blog is powered by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Xie_2017&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#39;&gt;Xie, Hill, and Thomas, 2017&lt;/a&gt;) which has the function &lt;code&gt;blogdown::shortcode()&lt;/code&gt; for embedding tweets. For example, &lt;code&gt;blogdown::shortcode(&amp;quot;tweet&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1054380320533950464&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; generates the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; syntax code which then &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; renders into the tweet itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I just completed my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ASHG18?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#ASHG18&lt;/a&gt; survey &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GeneticsSociety?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@GeneticsSociety&lt;/a&gt;. Took a few minutes and most of my feedback wouldn&amp;#39;t stand out. Except that I did use a box to suggest having a webinar with role playing scenarios that exemplify how the code of conduct can be used to diffuse harassment &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jsdron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@jsdron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/AKZdnGCr25&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/AKZdnGCr25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Dr. Leonardo Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1054380320533950464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;October 22, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, we can use Twitter itself by copy-pasting the code for embedding the tweet directly from the Twitter app/website. On the top right side menu on the tweet itself, select &lt;em&gt;Embed Tweet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.04.03%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then copy-paste the HTML code into your post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.04.28%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;quot;twitter-tweet&amp;quot; data-lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot; dir=&amp;quot;ltr&amp;quot;&amp;gt;I just completed my &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ASHG18?src=hash&amp;amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;quot;&amp;gt;#ASHG18&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; survey &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/GeneticsSociety?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;quot;&amp;gt;@GeneticsSociety&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Took a few minutes and most of my feedback wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t stand out.

&lt;p&gt;and here is how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be other ways of doing this that are specific to your blog platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that it should be possible to &lt;em&gt;bookmark&lt;/em&gt; the tweets on Twitter and then use an R package to extract your bookmarked tweets from the past 24 hours in order to simplify the process. Maybe this can be done with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rtweet&#34;&gt;rtweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; although I haven’t dived into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;new-to-blogdown&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, ask around. You might belong to a group or know someone that is willing to host a guest post in their &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; blog. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is hard. Some don’t mention the methods to avoid this issue, but then it becomes a “black box”. I guess that it can also be a “black box” if they don’t explain a bit what the model is/does. /shrug&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that it’s for US scientists, but I don’t think of the “Deep South” in the US when I hear “SouthSeq”. Anyway, SouthSeq looks like a great project with many ways to train others in genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ASHG18 tweet summary day 1</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/10/16/ashg18-tweet-summary-day-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/10/16/ashg18-tweet-summary-day-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ashg.org/2018meeting/&#34;&gt;American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2018 conference&lt;/a&gt;. The official hashtag for the conference is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ASHG18&#34;&gt;ASHG18&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. At first I was tweeting myself and checking both the &lt;em&gt;top&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt; tweets. As the day progressed I started a Google Doc to take notes during talks. I was missing some details so I was relying on the &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt; tweets and copy-pasting the tweet links to my notes. At some point I told myself I should simply turn this collection of tweet links into a simple blog post. So here it is for day 1. You can consider it a curated list of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ASHG18&#34;&gt;ASHG18&lt;/a&gt; tweets. Although it’s incomplete because it only covers the talks I went to starting from the Presidential address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linked tweets are frequently from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thatdnaguy&#34;&gt;Eli Robertson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman&#34;&gt;Michael Hoffmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but also from other Twitter users&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Hoffmann also writes multiple tweets per talk, though you’ll have to scroll through his timeline to find all the ones related to a talk. Unless I’m missing a way to make them into a thread.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Why I applied to join SNI: the Mexican National Researchers registry</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/29/why-i-applied-to-join-sni-the-mexican-national-researchers-registry/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/29/why-i-applied-to-join-sni-the-mexican-national-researchers-registry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago a friend of mine told me that I was on the list of newly admitted SNI members. A few have asked me since why did I request to join it. So here’s my public reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;es&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Woo! Ya soy &amp;quot;Investigador Nacional Nivel I&amp;quot; en el Sistema Nacional de Investigadores de CONACyT en México &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Conacyt_MX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@Conacyt_MX&lt;/a&gt; 🎉💪🏾🇲🇽&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m a National Researcher lvl I in the Mexican National Researchers Registry ^_^ 🎆🎉&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/hud7Z22WLY&#34;&gt;https://t.co/hud7Z22WLY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gracias &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/malacopa_genome?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@malacopa_genome&lt;/a&gt; por el aviso! &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/NWnf90KOF1&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NWnf90KOF1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Dr. Leonardo Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1045051193146396674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 26, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;sni&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SNI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let me tell you what SNI is. It stands for &lt;em&gt;Sistema Nacional de Investigadores&lt;/em&gt; which translates to National Researchers Registry. It’s a way that the Mexican government created in 1984 to recognize &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; quality researchers and encourage them to continue to do great research, teach the next generation of researchers and promote innovation (&lt;a href=&#34;https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistema_Nacional_de_Investigadores_(M%C3%A9xico)&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;). There are three types of members:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candidato a Investigador Nacional&lt;/em&gt;: Candidate to National Researcher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigador Nacional&lt;/em&gt;: National Researchers with 3 levels (1, 2 and 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigador Nacional Emérito&lt;/em&gt;: National Emeritus Researcher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become a member you have to submit documentation to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Conacyt_MX&#34;&gt;CONACyT&lt;/a&gt; showing that you have made contributions to science, technology, culture and society through scientific or technological developments, training new students, popularizing or translating science and technology, among other criteria. Once you are a member, you have to keep submitting new documents every couple of years to stay a member or advance in the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-real-reason-behind-joining-sni&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; reason behind joining SNI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a little bit that there are many critics of the SNI system. Most of the criticisms are based on how they decide what is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; contribution and how they judge applications. The reality is also that the process of sending the necessary documentation is cumbersome to say the least. The CONACyT website breaks often enough that it can be painful to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do people want to join the SNI and go through all this complicated process? The main reason (I think) why people want to join the SNI is because being a member comes with a financial supplement. It’s enough that I’ve heard that it can constitute about a third of your salary. You can find headlines such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/empresas/apoyo-del-conacyt-a-investigadores-paso-de-privilegio-a-sueldo&#34;&gt;how CONACyT’s support to researchers went from a priviledge to a salary&lt;/a&gt;. This financial supplement is given to those members that work 20 hours a week on Mexican institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how important this boost in salary is, I can understand very well the frustrations that come with interacting with the CONACyT website: specially when the website goes down and you have to submit your application before a given deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;so-why-did-i-apply-to-join-sni&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So why did I apply to join SNI?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find on CONACyT’s website an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.conacytprensa.mx/index.php/sociedad/politica-cientifica/7698-por-que-es-importante-pertenecer-al-sni&#34;&gt;interview on why it’s important to join SNI&lt;/a&gt; or go elsewhere to read a study on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sinectica.iteso.mx/index.php/SINECTICA/article/view/155/786&#34;&gt;motivations people have for joining SNI&lt;/a&gt;. But why did I apply to join SNI given that I’m outside Mexico and won’t be getting the financial supplement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main motivation was protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets say that I return to Mexico as a researcher at UNAM or another Mexican institution. Currently there is only 1 call for new SNI members per year. If I were to return today (September 2018), I would need to wait several months for the 2019 application cycle. Then I would need to wait several months for all applications to be evaluated and would probably start receiving the financial salary boost on January 2020. That is a lot of time to wait!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, right now I don’t need the salary boost. But if I were to return then it could be a significant portion of my salary. Having all this riding on a cumbersome application (I’d be afraid of making a silly mistake in the application) and on an external evaluation would be stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the stakes for me were low right now. Now that I’m a SNI member if I were to return to Mexico I could start receiving that financial boost much sooner. Thus I’m also protecting myself by keeping my options open to stay abroad (in the US for me) or return to Mexico. For example, I have a verbal agreement with my boss on the length of my current job, but technically I’m an employee at will and can be fired pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also applied because I have several friends that were applying or recently applied and helped me a lot navigate the application process&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Also, you never know if the application process will change and become more complicated later on: though I hope that it will get easier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to protection and security. My father has taught me that it’s our responsibility to cover our backs. Lets imagine that I have dependents. It would be irresponsible of me to miss out on the financial supplement because I didn’t send my documentation on time or because I forgot to send in the renewal documents: maybe it wouldn’t affect me, but it would affect them. Completing my application in time is under my control. What CONACyT cares about, their evaluation process, the clarity and reliability of their website are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;beyond-sni&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beyond SNI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attitude goes beyond SNI. That is why I compete when I can for awards and scholarships that I think fit me, even if its a long shot. No one will come to you and say, “hey, your work is great, now you are a SNI member” (or any award). I believe that you have to keep working and make it hard for others to say no to your applications. You have to keep trying though because you won’t get them all. That was one of my messages in my recent CDSBMexico keynote.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Problems with an article from the Baltimore Sun covering Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s immigration issues</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, September 19th 2018, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com/balnews-dan-rodricks-20130507-staff.html&#34;&gt;Dan Rodricks&lt;/a&gt; (Twitter: &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/DanRodricks&#34;&gt;DanRodricks&lt;/a&gt;) published an article in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com&#34;&gt;Baltimore Sun&lt;/a&gt;. The article was shared to me with the title &lt;em&gt;I only thought this happened to Mexicans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is currently titled&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/dan-rodricks-blog/bs-md-rodricks-0919-story.html&#34;&gt;“Rodricks: Hopkins library specialist hit by immigration crackdown after being blindsided by visa denial”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-19-problems-with-an-article-from-the-baltimore-sun-covering-dr-mahoney-steel-s-immigration-issues_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-19%20at%2011.43.50%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like the title at all nor did I feel right when reading the article. I shared it with about 50 other Mexicans in Baltimore&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, talked about it over dinner, discussed a bit with Hopkins colleagues, and now thanks to all of them I have a clearer idea of what my problems with this article are. And there are many of them, but we can group them into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reporting by Dan Rodricks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; handling of Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s case by Johns Hopkins University,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; lack of attention by Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into all of it, there is a petition online in support of Dr. Mahoney-Steel that you can read and sign &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/johns-hopkins-university-support-dr-tamsyn-mahoney-steel-and-all-displaced-workers&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you want: nearly 2,000 people have already signed it. You can also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/johns-hopkins-university-support-dr-tamsyn-mahoney-steel-and-all-displaced-workers/c?source_location=petition_show&#34;&gt;read other’s reasons&lt;/a&gt; for signing the petition. Right now I do not feel comfortable signing this petition, but maybe you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-reporting-by-dan-rodricks&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The reporting by Dan Rodricks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article starts by framing Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s story around the fact that she had to return to England due to issues with her immigration paperwork and that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the reaction of several friends and colleagues was uncannily the same: “I thought this only happened to Mexicans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no need at all to grab attention to Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s story by mentioning Mexicans or any other Spanish-speaking immigrants. Dan Rodricks is trying to get the reader to think that &lt;em&gt;Mexicans are illegal immigrants&lt;/em&gt; (which many politicians have said), and thus that &lt;em&gt;they aren’t welcome&lt;/em&gt;, and then &lt;em&gt;ohh, others aren’t welcome either&lt;/em&gt;. Another interpretation of this quote is that &lt;em&gt;Mexicans are uneducated&lt;/em&gt;, which would be equally offending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m glad that the title has been changed at the Baltimore Sun’s website, the first paragraph and last paragraph of the story still mention this quote that is attributed to friends and colleagues of Dr. Mahoney-Steel. They might have said this, but Dan Rodricks could have simply ignored their quote and framed his story along the lines of the updated title: a library specialist that is suffering because of the current immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second problem with the reporting is that there is a lack of information that is important in this context. There are many ways to become a permanent resident in the US and thus get a &lt;em&gt;green card&lt;/em&gt;. Some of these ways involve getting sponsored by your employer. Some don’t. Basically, in some situations it would be the employer’s responsibility (Johns Hopkins University in this case) to be involved in and be supportive and in others I think that they are not obliged to help financially. You can have very different reactions to this story based on what mechanism Dr. Mahoney-Steel was asking Johns Hopkins University to help her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-portrayed-handling-of-dr.mahoney-steels-case-by-hopkins&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; handling of Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s case by Hopkins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; here because we currently don’t know Hopkins’ side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems to be the main reason why Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s case became a story is because she submitted her documents to request a renewal of her H-1B (highly specialized worker) visa to Johns Hopkins University’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://ois.jhu.edu/&#34;&gt;Office of International Services&lt;/a&gt;. She didn’t hear back from them until she heard in August 21st that they decided not to send her documents to the US government and that she should leave the country by August 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hugely disturbing and would be enough to grab the attention of many readers. This is what caught the attention of several colleagues at Hopkins. We haven’t really heard the story from OIS’ perspective and I would definitely want to know more&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of details in the article, we don’t know exactly which mechanism Dr. Mahoney-Steel was asking Hopkins to help her with. She might have been considering applying under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/employment-based&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;employed-based immigration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1&#34;&gt;EB-1&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2&#34;&gt;EB-2&lt;/a&gt;. For the EB-1 I think that your employer has to help you quite a bit. But not all employers want to do so. Also these processes take a considerable amount of time, not 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, maybe Dr. Mahoney-Steel was asking Hopkins to help her pay for her green card &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/immediate-relative-us-citizen&#34;&gt;application through family&lt;/a&gt; since she’s married to a US citizen and due to their &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; extremely poor communication on her H-1B visa renewal. I haven’t heard of any employer helping their employees with the green card fees in such cases. It’d be great if they did it, but I wouldn’t expect this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-portrayed-lack-of-attention-by-dr.mahoney-steel&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; lack of attention by Dr. Mahoney-Steel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we don’t know how everything exactly happened. My issues here could be based on how Dan Rodricks used his notes from interviewing Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the Mexicans I shared the article with are not US citizens&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and thus have different types of visas that allow us to study and/or work in the US. We learn fast, either through personal experience or stories from others, that you have to prioritize any visa paperwork you have to do. That involves lots of planning and attention to detail. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing when your visa expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning the types of visas you can apply to after your current one expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fees associated with the different visa applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements for the visa you want to get: timeline, documents that you have, documents that you need to get, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating with all parties involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this information at hand you can make plans. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ois.jhu.edu/&#34;&gt;OIS&lt;/a&gt; is also pretty helpful, in my experience, as they provide seminars where they explain a lot of this information and you can also request to meet with one of their specialists. OIS also sends reminders that prompt you to get moving: get your documents ready and send them on time. Having defended OIS based on my experience I also have to say that I’ve heard them make costly mistakes that affected friends of mine. Ultimately, the immigrant is responsible for their own application and has to double check everything others make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I have learned myself that if something says that it can take between 60 and 90 days, that I should think that it’ll take 90 days and be happy if it takes less than that. This doesn’t mean that our plans are the best or that they always work out. It just means that we try to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, as portrayed, I’m surprised by Dr. Mahoney-Steel because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She didn’t contact OIS a few days after sending her documents to follow up on her case. If she had, maybe she would have had more time to convince them to actually send her H-1B visa renewal documents to the US government, ask for help for her green card (EB-1, EB-2?, EB-2 NIW?), ask for her direct employer (Sheridan Libraries) to intervene, etc. Still, OIS should have immediately notified her that they weren’t going to send her H-1B documents to the US government!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She has been married to a US citizen for less than two years (but over one)… and didn’t get a green card via an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/immediate-relative-us-citizen&#34;&gt;application through family&lt;/a&gt;. To my understanding, that’s one of the cheapest and fastest ways&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to apply for a green card. If you can get a green card, then you can stop worrying about visas. Isn’t that something we all want? Yes, it’s not free. The I-485&lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fee &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/i-485&#34;&gt;is 1,225 USD for someone aged 14 to 78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn8&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref8&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Say that you are applying via EB2-NIW and hiring some lawyers, then you are looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wegreened.com/Legal-Fees&#34;&gt;5,000 USD or more in lawyer fees alone plus another 700 USD for the government&lt;/a&gt;. Given the large advantages that you get from having a green card and her husband’s situation, I would hope that many would have helped Dr. Mahoney-Steel raise 1,225 USD. Luckily for Dr. Mahoney-Steel, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/family/family-us-citizens/bringing-spouses-live-united-states-permanent-residents&#34;&gt;she can still apply for a green card through family even if she is living outside the US&lt;/a&gt;. I would hope that Johns Hopkins would be willing to hire her back then, or maybe even now and have her work remotely from the UK while the green card application is being processed (if Hopkins has a branch in Europe).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does seem like Hopkins realized that they made a mistake (as portrayed in the article) because they covered her flight back to England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry to say this, but it ultimately looks to me that Dr. Mahoney-Steel felt entitled and never expected to face immigration problems. Though again, that’s the current lens I have, that is, Dan Rodricks’ article and the infamous quote from her friends and colleagues. That’s why it would be useful to hear more from Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;closing-remarks&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that Dan Rodricks and/or the Baltimore Sun edits his article to remove any mentions about Mexicans, which as they stand currently are all negative and ultimately offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hope that we get some clarification from Johns Hopkins University Office of International Services. Depending on what happened, they might have to apologize to Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an immigrant in the US, I encourage you to plan ahead as much as you can anything related to visa paperwork. The current administration will make it as hard as they can to legally immigrate to the US, read for example this article: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.propublica.org/article/authorities-can-now-deny-visa-and-green-card-applications-without-giving-applicants-a-chance-to-fix-errors&#34;&gt;“Authorities Can Now Deny Visa and Green Card Applications Without Giving Applicants a Chance to Fix Errors”&lt;/a&gt;. But you don’t need to make it harder on yourself by lack of planning. Take advantage of all the resources you have at your employer (OIS in this case) and ask your fellow immigrants to share their knowledge with you. Double check every document because others (like your employer) might have made mistakes in a form or letter (basically don’t trust experts will do their job perfectly) because the US government will make you pay (in time, lost opportunities, etc) if you make a mistake. If you are thinking about getting a green card, you can start by checking websites &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visapro.com/green-cards/&#34;&gt;like this one that lists all the possible ways to get one&lt;/a&gt; and by checking the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/eligibility-categories&#34;&gt;USCIS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ll write a letter to the Baltimore Sun including a link to this post. But that’s for tomorrow September 20th 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two friends thought of this quote by &lt;a href=&#34;https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/martin-niemoeller-first-they-came-for-the-socialists&#34;&gt;Martin Niemöller&lt;/a&gt; (which I didn’t know myself):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;acknowledgements&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank those who I discussed this article with and corrected some of my facts. If you want me to name you let me know and I’ll edit this post. I didn’t because going the other way around (from named to anonymous) is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw the article as a photo that was shared by Hopkins colleagues. Dan Rodrick’s Facebook page also shows the article with the original title.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 09/19/2018 at 10 pm ET.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us are students, alumni or even staff members at Hopkins and affiliated institutes (like myself).&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they ever can share their story due to privacy restrictions.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can be a dual citizen.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn6&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will still take months, say about 11 to 13 months from what I’ve heard.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref6&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn7&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The form you submit to get a green card.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref7&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn8&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might need to cover about another 400 USD in fees to get the documents that show that you have all the vaccines you need if you go to a place like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.passporthealthusa.com/locations/md/baltimore/162/&#34;&gt;Passport Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref8&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>What about a lawyer-like app as the minimum help for defendants in immigration cases?</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/17/what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/17/what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I attended the special panel discussion event at JHSPH called &lt;a href=&#34;http://hopkinshumanitarianhealth.org/news-events/events/separated-child-separation-at-the-border-a-health-and-human-rights-perspect&#34;&gt;“Separated: Children Separation at the Border A Health and Human Rights Perspective”&lt;/a&gt;. It got my mind racing and here’s an idea. It’s likely (definitely) incomplete, but maybe it’ll get others to think on related ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-17-what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases_files/ChildSepBorder.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://hopkinshumanitarianhealth.org/news-events/events/separated-child-separation-at-the-border-a-health-and-human-rights-perspect&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;panel-summary&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Panel summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel was composed by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ColleenKraft&#34;&gt;Colleen Kraft&lt;/a&gt;, President, American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EricSchwartzRI&#34;&gt;Eric Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;, President, Refugee International&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Escobar, Chief of Program and Services, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wearecasa.org/who-we-are/&#34;&gt;CASA de Maryland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pbspiegel&#34;&gt;Paul Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;, Director, Center for Humanitarian Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed the first 30 minutes or so but I still got to listen to most of it. The panel members presented many facts and here are some that will be relevant to the idea I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child separation is just one of the consequences of the current’s administration immigration policies implemented and enforced by the Department of Justice (ultimately headed by Jeff Sessions, the US Attorney General).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US is the only country (to the panel’s members knowledge) with a child separation policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to empathy many individuals across political lines reacted against child separation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US immigration system won’t really change much even if Democrats get elected. Obama did deport over 2 million individuals, though he prioritized &lt;em&gt;criminals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrested immigrants are not required by law to have representation (a lawyer) provided by the government&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minors (say 3 year old children) with no lawyers are being highlighted in the media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration cases where the defendants have lawyers drastically improve&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the odds for the defendants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges are human.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges typically used to (or maybe still do) try to give time for a minor to get a lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges are &lt;em&gt;alledgely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; being pressured to meet quotas in the range of 700 to 1,000 cases by year under the current administration. Thus judges sometimes have to close cases in a couple of hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges now basically have 2 options for closing a case: order deportation or (I’m missing the correct term) &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; the defendant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end the panel members highlighted that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; should take some type of action&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but that we should consider the consequences of our suggested policy changes. They also mentioned that we should take advantage of this moment (child separation got everyone’s attention) to raise the profile of the other problems with the current immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;my-way-of-taking-action-heres-an-idea&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My way of taking action: here’s an idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m by no means an immigration expert. My way of taking action is to share ideas, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2017/01/25/An-alternative-to-the-Mexico-US-wall-where-the-US-would-gain-millions-of-dollars/#.W6BV4v5Kg0o&#34;&gt;I’ve done in the past&lt;/a&gt;, that might be incomplete, unrealistic or even super flawed, but that hopefully motivate others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bare bones version of my idea was: what if immigrants could have an &lt;em&gt;automatic&lt;/em&gt; (programmed) lawyer and translator during their hearings? This would not be a replacement for actually having lawyers (say those provided by local governments or NGOs as George Escobar mentioned) but would raise the minimum bar for those immigrants who currently have their cases processed with no lawyers at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;getting-into-the-details&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting into the details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that we could get our hands on dozens/hundreds/thousands? of transcripts of immigration court hearings where we have the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the judge said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the government’s lawyer said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the defendant’s lawyer said (either to the judge or to the defendant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the defendant said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like a script for a play. We would additionally need a table with court hearing metadata such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome: deportation, being &lt;em&gt;freed&lt;/em&gt; (term?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date of the hearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State where the hearing occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then using machine learning (maybe with deep learning methods) process the text and try to determine potential suggestions an actual defendant’s lawyer would give to its defendant or respond to the judge/government’s lawyer. It might not always get things right, but I imagine that it would be better than the current state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automatic lawyer would need then to work as say a phone app that listens to what others are saying in the room. Say have 3 icons with one per person present (judge, defendant, gov’s lawyer). Then the defendant presses each button when each person is talking. The app then shows some 1 to say 3 suggested responses (with translations)&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and responds for the defendant in English once the defendant chooses an option (or goes with the top one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;implementing-an-initial-version-of-the-app&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implementing an initial version of the app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that large computing companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google would be willing to provide some compute credits on their clouds for the initial version of the algorithm that is &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to the court hearing and then provides suggestions. Think of this as the “suggested text” you get nowadays when typing emails on Gmail or text messages. Maybe these companies have programs where you can apply to have some of their engineers help you for a certain number of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that one big initial challenge would be to get that collection of transcripts from immigration court hearings where defendant lawyer(s) were present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that automated lawyers are not allowed currently in courts. But compared to providing human lawyers in all immigration cases, this change might be more &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; to pass as a law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that some phone companies might be willing to provide some refurbished phones that only have this app installed and are kept safe in the immigration courts. And well, satisfy any security requirements the government has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;improving-the-app&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improving the app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets say that you get that alpha version of the app working. If we had volunteer lawyers annotate the transcripts with some information about the intent behind what each person said (it could start with just 3 options: negative, positive, neutral from the perspective of the defendant) that could maybe help the algorithm that processes the transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we also had more detailed court hearing metadata such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location of the court (I imagine a that a few judges work in each court)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demographics of the defendants: like which country or even region of the country where they come from, whether the defendant has any family support, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Category information for the court hearing (maybe cases can be grouped into a few categories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I imagine that the app would be able to have more personalized experience, like re-adjust the suggestions based on which court you are located at and adapt the translations to the Spanish version the defendant is most familiar with (we say &lt;em&gt;buddy&lt;/em&gt; in so many different ways as shown below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-17-what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases_files/bromap.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pictoline/photos/a.1611821172410355.1073741828.1598399590419180/1623937737865365/?type=1&amp;amp;fref=nf&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app could also be connected to remote human immigration lawyers than can intervene remotely when the suggestions algorithm doensn’t know what to do. Maybe this could be part of some social service that immigration lawyers (regardless of their personal political preferences) could do as some elective during their formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;doing-some-convincing&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doing some convincing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that you could try to get support for this automatic immigration lawyer by arguing that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s better than no lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s cheaper than having lawyers for all cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves processing times on average (ideally) such that immigration judges can fulfill their quotas (here I’m hoping that it reduces the rate at which cases are closed with deportation orders).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is more humane than having a minor with no help. Though I hope that immigration judges would still try to give time for children to secure a lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might be implemented earlier (years earlier?) than changes in immigration law requiring that all defendants have a human lawyer in immigration cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If human lawyers can help through the app, then it also increases the number of jobs for immigration lawyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea has potentially many flaws because like any system, people on both sides will try to game it. This is where having a large set of transcripts would be useful as well as continuous updates to the algorithm such that gaming the system actually becomes hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this is just an idea, or a collection of them around one theme. It would need serious work to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could be with your vote, helping members in your community that are affected, improving how we translate research into terms everyone understands, improving the education about the violent reality many are trying to escape by coming to the US, approaching local governments, etc.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post we will describe the package &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) that was one of the projects developed during the &lt;a href=&#34;http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/TIB2018/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34;&gt;TIB2018-BCDW&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to continue developing &lt;a href=&#34;http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/griffin/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Griffin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;). If you have ideas, suggestions or bugs, please contact us via &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boolean networks allow us to give a mechanistic explanation to how cell types emerge from regulatory networks. However, inferring the regulatory network and its functions is complex problem, as the available information is often incomplete. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) uses available biological information (regulatory interactions, cell types, mutants) codified as a set of restrictions and returns the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_network&#34;&gt;Boolean Networks&lt;/a&gt; that satisfy that restrictions. This Boolean networks can then be used to study the biological system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) package is an R connector to &lt;a href=&#34;http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/griffin/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Griffin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Gene Regulatory Interaction Formulator For Inquiring Networks), a java library for inference and analysis of Boolean Network models. &lt;a href=&#34;http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/griffin/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Griffin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; takes as inputs biologically meaningful constraints and turns them into a symbolic representation. Using a SAT engine, &lt;a href=&#34;http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/griffin/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Griffin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explores the Boolean Network search space, finding all satisfying assignments that are compatible with the specified constraints. The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) package includes a number of functions to interact with the BoolNet package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-small-example&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A small example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us suppose a cell, we know that this cell has three proteins called &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt;. We know that &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; activates &lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt; and that &lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt; inhibit each other. We also suspect that &lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt; have positive self-regulatory loops. We can add this interactions to the table as “OPU” (optional, positive, unambiguous). This dataframe is the topology of the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Source&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Target&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Interaction&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;OPU&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;OPU&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we also have some information of what cell types have been observed. For example, there is a cell type that expresses &lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt;, but not &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt; and an other cell type that expresses &lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt;, but not &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt;. There might exist a third cell type that has not been fully characterized where we know that the cell expresses no &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt; but we have NO information on &lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt;. This dataframe is the attractors of the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;a&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;b&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;c&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then use this information to create a query. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) can include other types of information like transition between cell type, cycles, transitions between cell types or mutant cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Install using:
# devtools::install_github(&amp;#39;mar-esther23/rgriffin&amp;#39;)
## Note that the package depends on rJava

library(&amp;#39;rGriffin&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Loading required package: rJava&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;genes = c(&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;)
inter = data.frame(source=c(&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;), 
                  target=c(&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;), 
                  type=c(&amp;#39;+&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;-&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;-&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;OPU&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;OPU&amp;#39;),
                    stringsAsFactors = F )
q = create.gquery.graph(inter, genes)
attr = data.frame(a=c(0,&amp;#39;*&amp;#39;,0), 
                 b=c(0,1,0), 
                 c=c(0,0,1),
                 stringsAsFactors = F )
q = add.gquery.attractors(q, attr)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we can use &lt;code&gt;Griffin&lt;/code&gt; to find the networks that behave according with our biological information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nets = run.gquery(q)
nets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple options to integrate &lt;code&gt;BoolNet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;). The function &lt;code&gt;get.net.topology()&lt;/code&gt; can obtain the topology with interaction signs of a BoolNet network. The function &lt;code&gt;attractor2dataframe()&lt;/code&gt; can be used to export a BoolNet attractor as a dataframe that &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) can use. The function &lt;code&gt;run.gquery()&lt;/code&gt; includes the option &lt;code&gt;return=’BoolNet’&lt;/code&gt;, that return the inferred networks as &lt;code&gt;BoolNet&lt;/code&gt; networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;history&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of &lt;a href=&#34;http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/griffin/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Griffin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; began in 2013 as a PAPIIT (Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigación e Innovación Tecnológica) project to solve the inference of Boolean Network models for the &lt;strong&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/strong&gt; root stem cell niche. It continued in 2015 with support of Conacyt grant 221341.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, 2017 we organized a course in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.c3.unam.mx&#34;&gt;C3-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; to teach biologist how to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/griffin/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Griffin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We received two main comments: the input format was too complicated and it was uncomfortable to use the output with other packages. After some consideration we decided to create an &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; wrapper that could export and import &lt;code&gt;BoolNet&lt;/code&gt; networks. We selected &lt;code&gt;BoolNet&lt;/code&gt; as it has an good documentation and the package &lt;code&gt;BoolFilter&lt;/code&gt; had been designed to work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) began during the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fejer.ucol.mx/biomate/&#34;&gt;EOBM 2017&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.ucol.mx/cuib/&#34;&gt;CUIB&lt;/a&gt;. For the following year we continued developing &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) as our schedules allowed. There were multiple challenges during the development: defining user-friendly inputs, using &lt;code&gt;Rjava&lt;/code&gt;, and structuring the package. In August 2018, we attended the &lt;a href=&#34;http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/TIB2018/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34;&gt;TIB2018-BCDW&lt;/a&gt; where we received valuable guidance from Martin Morgan and Benilton S Carvalho. It was during this workshop that the first version of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mar-esther23/rGriffin&#34;&gt;rGriffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-Martinez-Sanchez_2018&#39;&gt;Martinez-Sanchez, Muñoz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) was finished.&lt;/p&gt;
