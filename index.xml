&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr Please post your question at the Bioconductor support website &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://support.bioconductor.org/&lt;/a&gt; and check the posting guide &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s important that you provide reproducible code and information about your R session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been getting more questions about several packages I maintain. It&amp;rsquo;s great to see more interest from users, but at the same time most questions lack the information I need to help the users. I have also gotten most of the questions via email, which is why I am writing this post. As of today, I will no longer answer questions related to my Bioconductor packages via personal emails. This might sound harsh, but hopefully the rest of this post will convince you that it&amp;rsquo;s the best thing to do. You might also be interested in the basics of using &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/derfinder/inst/doc/derfinder-quickstart.html#basics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;derfinder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/regionReport/inst/doc/regionReport.html#basics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;regionReport&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/recount/inst/doc/recount-quickstart.html#basics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recount&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bioconductor project is a community project and it benefits from users interacting in public venues. When a user asks a question at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bioconductor support website&lt;/a&gt;, they are providing information that future users might be interested in. That is, the user (&lt;strong&gt;U1&lt;/strong&gt;) is contributing information to the overall documentation around the Bioconductor package they are asking a question about. Ideally, a new user (&lt;strong&gt;U2&lt;/strong&gt;) can then read through the question U1 wrote, check the solution, and move on. This is one of the main reasons why we (developers) want questions to be well documented. There are a couple of quick things that U1 can check that will make their question much more useful to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt = &#39;shinycsv landing&#39; width=&#39;600&#39; src=&#39;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2017-03-06-bioc-support/question.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;session-information&#34;&gt;Session information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the strengths of Bioconductor is that all the packages have vignettes and lots of documentation. The packages are also checked regularly and must pass some tests. That also means that packages can change frequently, at least more frequently than CRAN packages. There&amp;rsquo;s also the added complexity that at any given point in time there is a release branch and a development branch. This means that there are many variables and saying that you are using the &amp;ldquo;latest version&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean much to the developer. All of this information and more is part of the &lt;em&gt;R session information&lt;/em&gt;. That is why I and others request users to post their session information. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to get, simply run the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Install devtools if needed
# install.packages(&#39;devtools&#39;)

## Reproducibility info
library(&#39;devtools&#39;)
options(width = 120)
session_info()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output might be too long to post in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bioconductor support website&lt;/a&gt;. The easy solution is to save the information you want displayed in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;. Then simply add the gist link in your question. Note that you need to have the link under &amp;ldquo;text&amp;rdquo; formatting and not &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-to-reproduce-the-error&#34;&gt;Code to reproduce the error&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If U1 includes the session information, their question will be pretty good, but not ideal yet. Many of the questions I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked do not include code for me to figure out the exact steps of what they were doing. A lot of times I can infer pieces of what they were doing from their description of the problem. But doing so takes quite a bit of my time and effort, and is still not perfect. Now imagine that U2 is reading through the question: they would probably get lost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wide range of things that U1 could have done. To help the developer, the best thing is for the user to include the code that lead to the error. The code should include how the data was loaded, so that the developer can run it themselves and check in more detail what went wrong. This means providing a small subset of the data or using some publicly available data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that writing code that reproduces the error is not easy. But it helps a lot for learning more about R and Bioconductor. I can tell you that I went through the same process, and in my experience you can find out what you are doing wrong by writing the reproducible code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extra&#34;&gt;Extra&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other tips that are useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;traceback()&lt;/code&gt; immediately after getting the error and include the output in your question, that would be great. It makes it easier to check at what point the code failed and produced the error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently when I ask questions myself, I include the &amp;ldquo;non-evaluated code&amp;rdquo; (clean code in your script) and &amp;ldquo;evaluated code&amp;rdquo; (think of the R console: a mix of code and output). The non-evaluated code makes it easier for others to copy-paste the code into their R session without having to deal with any formatting issues (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/leekgroup/recount/issues/8#issue-210124094&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you encounter a new error, post a new question instead of &amp;ldquo;replying&amp;rdquo; to the first one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be polite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now you should be ready to post some great questions! Thanks for contributing to the Bioconductor community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An alternative to the Mexico-US wall where the US would gain millions of dollars</title>

      <description>

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr There is a 600 million to 2 billion USD annual market related to crossing the Mexico-US border. Allow temporary work visas (say 3 years) to take over this market and use the money to boost the US Border Patrol to build a wall of eyes, not a physical wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;President Trump of the United States of America,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cc President Peña Nieto of the United Mexican States&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Wednesday January 25th 2017, you are expected to announce your plans about building a wall between the United States and Mexico. I am opposed to building that wall but I also believe that providing alternatives is important when disagreeing. With that in mind, let me expose an alternative to your physical wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico has a net immigration rate of -1.7 migrants per 1,000 and a population of 123,166,749 individuals&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which means that about 209,000 people leave Mexico every year. The Department of Homeland Security 2014 report&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows that 350,177 out of 679,996 (51%) total aliens apprehended are from Mexico (52% reported elsewhere&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Many of the illegal immigrants pay people for helping them cross the Mexico-US border also known as &lt;em&gt;coyotes&lt;/em&gt;. Some informal surveys put the cost of a &lt;em&gt;coyote&lt;/em&gt; between 3,000 and 20,000 US dollars&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That means that there is an annual market worth about 627 to 1,050 million US dollars. This market exists and has been steady for years now. A physical wall in the Mexico-US border might not stop the illegal immigration to the US. Loss of jobs in Mexico directly related to your policies might even prompt more people to leave Mexico&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I believe that the high volume of people crossing the Mexico-US border makes it easier for drug cartels to hide and transport drugs. That is, it makes it harder for the US Border Patrol Agents to find who is transporting drugs and the track down the routes they use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what if the US took over this multi million dollar market? I have had the opportunity to visit countries that offer temporary work visas (ranging from 6 months to 3 years). The people interested in these visas have to pay a fee, pass a background check and sometimes go through health screenings. I believe that these immigrants pay the fee because it allows them to legally migrate, work for a while, save some money, and then go back to their home countries. From an immigrant&amp;rsquo;s perspective, it must be very appealing to pay the same amount of money it cost to migrate safely and legally (for temporary work) than to attempt to cross the border illegally with the risk of dying in the process or getting kidnapped. Additionally, I think that temporary workers would feel much safer to go out of their homes while in the US, spending some of their hard earned money in the process and stimulating the local economy. They would be more likely to get a regular job where they would pay income taxes instead of getting payed &lt;em&gt;under the table&lt;/em&gt; and dodging the IRS. Furthermore, having the opportunity to legally go back home and visit family would be a huge advantage from an immigrant&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing this letter I realized that the idea of &lt;em&gt;immigration tariffs&lt;/em&gt; is not new&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, I have not heard it being discussed recently and simply ask that you consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try to convince you that &lt;em&gt;immigration tariffs&lt;/em&gt; are an interesting alternative, consider what your government could do with an additional 600 to 1,000 million US dollars a year &amp;ndash; or multiply those numbers by two to get 1.2 to 2 billions USD a year by taking into account that about 50% of illegal immigrants are Mexicans. The average Border Patrol Agent self-reported salary is 80,250 USD a year&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The actual salaries range from 21,616 to 157,257 USD as of January 2017&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the &lt;em&gt;grade&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;level&lt;/em&gt; as well as other options&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In 2016, there were nearly 20,000 border patrol agents in the US&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That means that you could decide to increase the number of Border Patrol Agents by 10,000 (50%) for about 803 million USD or increase the number of Agents by 5,000 while increasing their salaries by 10% for about 602 million USD. Why do I bring up the number of Agents? Because that would mean that you are building a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;wall&lt;/em&gt; of eyes&lt;/strong&gt; in the Mexico-US border. I believe that under this scenario, you and your public relations team could convince your supporters that you delivered on your campaign promise of building a wall. It would just be a different kind of wall. The extra Border Patrol Agents and/or happier Agents (due to their increased salary) along with fewer attempts to cross the border (because immigrants would be interested in paying the &lt;em&gt;immigration tariff&lt;/em&gt;) would make them more efficient in their jobs. Some of them could be dedicated to making sure no one overstays their temporary work visa. Also note that by law, you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be a US citizen to become a Border Patrol Agent&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so you would be increasing US jobs by 5 to 10 thousand under this scenario. That is more than the 700 jobs you claim to have saved from moving to Mexico from the US by cancelling the plans to build a factory in Mexico&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I also imagine that this scenario would boost bus and airplane ticket sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of the opinion that &lt;em&gt;immigration tariffs&lt;/em&gt; would allow many individuals to have hope that they can improve their economic situation for them and their families. It would also translate &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; into a specific monetary goal. As of yesterday, 3,000 USD is about 64,000 MXN&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that translates to 800 days of minimum wage salary in Mexico&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Saving that amount of money would take over 2 years if the person didn&amp;rsquo;t spend any of their income! While ideally the &lt;em&gt;immigration tariff&lt;/em&gt; would be lower than 3,000 USD, ultimately there would be a threshold that opens doors to more economic opportunity. So, Peña Nieto and Mexico have the challenge of showing that Mexicans can stay in Mexico and improve their economical situation if they can save that amount of money to start a small business, advance their education, among other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migration involves two sides and as presidents of two countries of &lt;em&gt;united states&lt;/em&gt; (American and Mexican, respectively) I encourage you to keep thinking how to &lt;em&gt;unitedly&lt;/em&gt; address migration and take over the multi million dollar market that &lt;em&gt;coyotes&lt;/em&gt; currently control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best,
Leonardo&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had to explore a table with data? I believe the answer is &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt; for most people that work at a computer or even just use it for communicating with their friends and family. Tables of data pop up everywhere, for example in personal finance. Websites like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mint.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mint.com&lt;/a&gt; allow you to download your transactions in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSV&lt;/a&gt; file called &lt;code&gt;transactions.csv&lt;/code&gt;. CSV is one of the many formats for storing tables and most likely when you try to open the &lt;code&gt;transactions.csv&lt;/code&gt; file, it will open with Excel. Now, can you make a quick figure of one of your columns in your table?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will answer yes, others no. The basic issue is that it&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; easy to explore your data in Excel or similar programs. Wait, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be easy? 😕&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you want to subset your data and want to re-make the plot? How about getting some simple statistics like the mean or frequency of some categories for a given variable? 😨 These are some of the immediate tasks that are helpful when exploring data. Visually, making figures with two variables is also very common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers and experts in Excel, Stata, &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; among other options can perform these data explorations. It might take them a little bit of time to write the code or remember it or use the user interface menu of their program of choice. But what about everyone else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libd.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lieber Institute for Brain Development&lt;/a&gt; where I work, it&amp;rsquo;s common for us to exchange data in tables, and thus explore data. That&amp;rsquo;s why we created &lt;code&gt;shinycsv&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-shinycsv&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://github.com/LieberInstitute/shinycsv&#39;&gt;Collado-Torres, Semick, and Jaffe, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;rsquo;s an R package &lt;a id=&#39;cite-cran&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.R-project.org/&#39;&gt;R Core Team, 2016&lt;/a&gt;) that contains a &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-shiny&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny&#39;&gt;Chang, Cheng, Allaire, Xie, et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;) application that allows users to interactively explore a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is a pretty high bar, that&amp;rsquo;s why we are hosting this application at &lt;a href=&#34;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/shinycsv/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/shinycsv/&lt;/a&gt;. Try it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/shinycsv/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt = &#39;shinycsv landing&#39; width=&#39;600&#39; src=&#39;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2017-01-20-shinycsv/landing.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shinycsv-application&#34;&gt;shinycsv application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application includes data about cars to demonstrate what it can do. It&amp;rsquo;s a small data set that is commonly used for demonstration purposes. Anyhow, in the application you&amp;rsquo;ll notice a few tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application shows the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;raw data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in an interactive table that allows you to subset the observations by some criteria, search in the table, and sort in different ways. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;raw summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tab shows quick statistical summaries which depend on the variable type (numerical, categorical, etc). If you interacted with the table in &lt;em&gt;raw data&lt;/em&gt; then the summaries at &lt;em&gt;raw summary&lt;/em&gt; will be based on the subset you selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one variable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;two variables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tabs are for making figures based on one or two variables at a time. The code in &lt;code&gt;shinycsv&lt;/code&gt; tries to guess what&amp;rsquo;s the best figure for a given type of variable and in case that you are interested in learning R, it also shows the exact code you can use to reproduce the figure in your computer. We added this feature to excite users about learning R. And it&amp;rsquo;s useful for advanced users too that might want to customize the resulting figures. Hm&amp;hellip;, you don&amp;rsquo;t like the colors we chose for the figure? Well go to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;plot colors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, choose another color, and come back to see your new figure with the color of your choosing. 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hm&amp;hellip; but what if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a CSV file? Well, &lt;code&gt;shinycsv&lt;/code&gt; can handle many different tables thanks to &lt;code&gt;rio&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-rio&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-rio&#39;&gt;Chan, Chan, Leeper, and Becker, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Even Excel sheets! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, go ahead and test it out! We&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to hear your feedback at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LieberInstitute/shinycsv/issues&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LieberInstitute/shinycsv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that when I referred to tables earlier, I referred to square tables with different variables (age, height, weight, etc) as columns as observations as rows. That is, Excel files with a single sheet with no comments or figures inside the Excel file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you interested in learning more about &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt;? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll want to take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/shinycsv-showcase/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;showcase mode version of the application&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use &lt;code&gt;shinycsv::explore()&lt;/code&gt; locally, the file size limit is increased to 500 MB. Although at that point you might want to consider using &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; or another programming language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about casting variables? If you want to have fine control about casting the variables, save your data in a RData file. Sure, this requires an R user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Finding possible class schedules</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2016/08/02/materias</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend my brother wanted to figure out his class schedule for the next semester. He is a veterinary medicine and zootechnology student at UNAM. For this upcoming semester there is a set of classes he has to take and each has 8 or so instructor options. The website where he finds the class times lists about 8 pre-constructed class schedules. So he normally finds one he likes quite a bit, and then manually starts checking if he can change X instructor for Y for a given class. He does this based on the referalls and information he has gathered about the instructors, plus he factors in whether it&amp;rsquo;d be an overall better schedule. For example, he might prefer to have a packed Tuesday if that means that he can leave early on Friday and avoid classes on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to make a mistake. You (well he) gets all excited thinking that he&amp;rsquo;s found the perfect schedule. Only to then realize that there is a conflict between two classes. Or that the practical portion of a class is in a location one hour away from the university, meaning that the schedule he has selected won&amp;rsquo;t work. This process is very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was watching him and I started to think if I could help him with some code. Turns out that it was straightforward to write some code to find which options are valid. Once I wrote a test case, it took us like half an hour to fill out the data. I know that tomorrow is when he and his classmates start registering for classes, so this information might help his classmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I define some helper functions. These are rather straightforward but I&amp;rsquo;ll be using them later on. For example, &lt;code&gt;dias()&lt;/code&gt; is just there for typing less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;## Helper functions
dias &amp;lt;- function(d, i) {
    paste0(d, i)
}

extract &amp;lt;- function(m, p) {
    m[[p]]
}

extract_names &amp;lt;- function(m, p) {
    names(m)[p]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next comes the input information. I organized it in a set of nested &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; objects. The schedule is stored as a character vector. For example, Lucia Eliana&amp;rsquo;s class meets on Wednesdays (&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;iercoles in Spanish) from 9 to 11 am. I only keep the starting hours (9 and 10 am) because otherwise the code won&amp;rsquo;t detect valid opitons that include another class that starts at 11 am. For classes that are 1 hour away from the university, we included 1 hour before and 1 hour after the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;## Input class/prof info and schedule
materias &amp;lt;- list(
    repro = list(
        &#39;lucia eliana&#39; = c(dias(&#39;m&#39;, 9:10), dias(&#39;j&#39;, 9:10), dias(&#39;v&#39;, 8:13)),

        &#39;1706&#39; = c(dias(&#39;ma&#39;, 15:17), dias(&#39;m&#39;, 15:19)),
        &#39;1707&#39; = c(dias(&#39;ma&#39;, 10:12), dias(&#39;j&#39;, 10:15)),

        &#39;1709&#39; = c(dias(&#39;l&#39;, 11:13), dias(&#39;j&#39;, 8:13)),
        &#39;1711&#39; = c(dias(&#39;j&#39;, 13:15), dias(&#39;v&#39;, 10:13))
    )
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the input information is complete, I use &lt;code&gt;expand.grid()&lt;/code&gt; to find out all the different possible options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;## Get all the options
options &amp;lt;- expand.grid(lapply(materias, function(x) { seq_len(length(x))}))
dim(options)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 81000     5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s 81,00 of them including the classes that meet on Saturday. You can see why it&amp;rsquo;s a frustrating process to find which combination of classes work when doing this manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I explore all these options to find those that are valid, meaning that none of the classes overlap. I do this by finding which options have no duplicated hours from the character vectors defined earlier. Nothing fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;valid &amp;lt;- apply(options, 1, function(input) {
    info &amp;lt;- mapply(extract, materias, input)
    !any(duplicated(unlist(info)))
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the valid options, I can find the names of the instructors for them. There&amp;rsquo;s 2,847 valid schedules in the end, out of the 81,000. That&amp;rsquo;s 3.5 percent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;valid_prof &amp;lt;- apply(options[valid, ], 1, function(input) {
    mapply(extract_names, materias, input)
})
ncol(valid_prof)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 2847
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can search the interactive version &lt;a href=&#34;https://lcolladotor.shinyapps.io/materias/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to select only the options with a given instructor. For example, in my brother&amp;rsquo;s case there are 30 valid options once he decided to prioritize two instructors as shown in the non-interactive table below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;## Ideally, this code would create an interactive table, but it doesn&#39;t work for some reason:
#library(&#39;DT&#39;)
#datatable(t(valid_prof), options = list(pagingType=&#39;full_numbers&#39;, pageLength=10), rownames = FALSE)
valid_prof &amp;lt;- t(valid_prof)
rownames(valid_prof) &amp;lt;- seq_len(nrow(valid_prof))
top_options &amp;lt;- valid_prof[valid_prof[, 1] == &#39;lucia eliana&#39; &amp;amp; valid_prof[, 2] %in% c(&#39;isaac reyes&#39;, &#39;isaac reyes 2&#39;), ]
kable(top_options, format = &#39;markdown&#39;, row.names = TRUE)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;repro&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;bacterianas&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;parasitarias&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;diagnosticas&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.imagechef.com/ic/ribbon/&#39;&gt;&lt;img alt = &#39;Federico Sanchez Ribbon&#39; height=&#39;300&#39; src=&#39;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2016-04-04-FedericoSanchez/Fede-Ribbon.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UNAM&lt;/a&gt; community at large mourns the passing of Federico Sánchez Rodríguez. He got his bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.quimica.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;School of Chemistry - UNAM&lt;/a&gt;, masters and PhD degrees from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biomedicas.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Biomedicas - UNAM&lt;/a&gt;, postdoc from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ucsf.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;, was a member of CIFN-UNAM now called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ccg.unam.mx/en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; (it&amp;rsquo;s his affiliation in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jbc.org/content/258/20/12618.full.pdf+html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; 1983 paper), and worked most of his career at &lt;a href=&#34;http://ibt.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IBT-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.ibt.unam.mx/server/PRG.base?tipo:doc,dir:PRG.curriculum,par:federico&#39;&gt;&lt;img alt = &#39;Federico Sanchez homepage&#39; height=&#39;227&#39; src=&#39;http://www.ibt.unam.mx/img/fot/federico.gif&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure that he made many friends, trained many students at all levels, and had a highly productive academic career as evidenced on his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ibt.unam.mx/server/PRG.base?tipo:doc,dir:PRG.curriculum,par:federico&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt; where he lists many papers, patents, etc. A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S%C3%A1nchez%20F%5BAuthor%5D&amp;amp;cauthor=true&amp;amp;cauthor_uid=26911872&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PubMed author search&lt;/a&gt; includes his papers but be careful to not confuse him with other authors that shared his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll remember Federico fondly for the time we shared at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/es/about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;. He was a great teacher and motivated me to ask as many questions as I could think of. My background in biology was weaker than my classmates, and I loved to ask questions of the sort: if X biolgical process is possible, could Y happen in the cell? He let my imagination run wild. Federico was very supportive of an elective class a few of us organized in our 4th year. You could always tell that he fed off the energy of enthusiastic students. He was always there if you needed some advice. At the end of my time at LCG-UNAM, he enjoyed how I argued against other members of the LCG academic committee. He always supported me in my non-traditional choices. Federico knew many things about plants, but also about the best food, the best drinks, and was always eager to share his knowledge with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of my last interactions with him at &lt;em&gt;FedeFest&lt;/em&gt; in August 2014, I asked him a question in the style that I used to during class. I asked him how would he evaluate results from single-cell sequencing and verify that the results were indeed biogical and not technical. A month later, I sent him &lt;a href=&#34;http://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0452-9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fede, I will always remember you fondly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best,
Leonardo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a busy week. I just flew in last night from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/enar2016&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;#ENAR2016&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m getting ready for a postdoc interview tomorrow, which means that I&amp;rsquo;m also flying today. On the flight back from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/enar2016&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;#ENAR2016&lt;/a&gt; I started reading a book my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/StrictlyStat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;John Muschelli&lt;/a&gt; bought for me. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;strong&gt;The Happiness Advantage&lt;/strong&gt; by Shawn Anchor and so far I&amp;rsquo;m loving it. There are several things that it talks about that I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past, but maybe not in the past year. Anyhow, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably talk about it in a separate blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But coincidentally, a friend of mine from undergrad just shared with me the following YouTube video. Watching it made me very happy! We definitely had a blast during undergrad. The person that talks about Boston is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Bieber&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Frederick Bieber&lt;/a&gt; (he&amp;rsquo;s kinda hard to google due to his last name) who at the time worked with 5 of my classmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My undergrad class from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/es/about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; (link is in English) was the 3rd one (yup, still guinea pigs) and the only one to start off with 40 students. Some left to study other degrees, most of us continue to work in academia getting our master&amp;rsquo;s, PhDs, postdocs done; others have chosen different career paths, and sadly one of us already passed away. But I bet we can all say that 2005-2009 were good and &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt; years.&lt;/p&gt;
