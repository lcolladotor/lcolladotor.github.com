&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently been getting reminder emails from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencemag.org/science-scilifelab-prize-young-scientists&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; SciLifeLab Prize for Young Scientists&lt;/a&gt;. The application deadline is July 15th, 2018!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I submitted an entry to this competition and I enjoyed the experience, even if it was a bit rushed. The process of joining the competition is relatively straight forward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an essay about your Ph.D. thesis work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a recommendation letter from your Ph.D. advisor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a short Ph.D. thesis abstract section, list your affiliation, education, academic and professional awards and professional experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include references.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to pay for competing! You already did the very hard part of completing your Ph.D.!!! I also like competitions like this one that invite you to think about your thesis and how to explain it. You should note that you are only eligible to participate once in this competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read about the 4 winners from 2017 at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencemag.org/prizes/SciLifeLab/2017&#34;&gt;www.sciencemag.org/prizes/SciLifeLab/2017&lt;/a&gt; and other years too to draw some inspiration from. I didn’t win, but I’m still going to share my entry in case it’s useful to others. I’m also sharing it to keep with the theme of also sharing your failures that I talked in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/11/mindfulness/#.WyrJbBJKjUI&#34;&gt;mindfulness post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know exactly why my entry was not selected (you might have some ideas on how to improve it!). But I can tell you that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I knew the deadline was coming but I wrote it the week it was due.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn’t have time to ask for some more specific feedback from others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I forgot that a recommendation letter was needed, so I asked at the very last minute for one by &lt;a href=&#34;http://jtleek.com/&#34;&gt;Jeff Leek&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know what magic he did (likely skipping a few hours of sleep, sorry!!!) but he managed to send it in time. Oops!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if I should have emphasized more the impact of my Ph.D. thesis work or what else to do. However, I do know that this exercise was useful. First, just re-reading my essay makes me smile. Also, Figure 1 shown here became a figure in the &lt;code&gt;recount-workflow&lt;/code&gt; paper &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Collado-Torres_2017&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1558/v1&#39;&gt;Collado-Torres, Nellore, and Jaffe, 2017&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, when I was notified about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioinformatics-peer-prize-iii.thinkable.org/&#34;&gt;Thinkable Bioinformatics Peer Prize III&lt;/a&gt; I didn’t have to think twice about joining that competition. Finally, since I wrote it in an Rmd file, it was easy to modify for this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I’ve said, you have nothing to lose by joining this competition. Yes, you have to invest a bit of time. But it can be helpful and morale boosting! Plus, you have a chance to win it!!! Just remember that the deadline is July 15th, 2018 (and to give your advisor enough time to write their recommendation letter for you)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you are curious, here are my full &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/lcolladotor/657aaae9d16aff3ce468f44f8780a317&#34;&gt;entry files&lt;/a&gt; (the figure is here though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here’s my full entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;usable-human-gene-expression-data-and-annotation-agnostic-methods&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usable human gene expression data and annotation-agnostic methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become the predominant assay for measuring gene expression. RNA-seq allows us to measure all expressed genes, improve gene and transcript annotation, and measure expressed sequences that otherwise are excluded in microarray studies. Typical RNA-seq analysis starts with a matrix containing the number of RNA-seq reads overlapping each gene for each sample &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Love et al. 2016; Law et al. 2016)&lt;/span&gt;. To compute such a matrix, you first map the raw data to the genome with aligners such as &lt;em&gt;TopHat2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;HISAT&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Kim et al. 2013; Kim, Langmead, and Salzberg 2015)&lt;/span&gt; and then use tools such as &lt;em&gt;Rsubread&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;HTSeq&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Y, GK, and W 2013; Anders, Pyl, and Huber 2014)&lt;/span&gt; to construct the read count matrix. After measuring enough samples, you can determine which genes are differentially expressed between two or more groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my graduate studies with Jeff Leek, the most commonly used methods for differential expression analysis were &lt;em&gt;DESeq&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Anders and Huber 2010)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;em&gt;edgeR&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Robinson, McCarthy, and Smyth 2010)&lt;/span&gt;. Leek and colleagues put together a set of gene count matrices in a project called &lt;em&gt;ReCount&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Frazee, Langmead, and Leek 2011)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;em&gt;ReCount&lt;/em&gt; allowed researchers to access several datasets without having to run the whole processing pipeline. &lt;em&gt;ReCount&lt;/em&gt; then helped the development of new methods such as &lt;em&gt;DESeq2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Love, Huber, and Anders 2014)&lt;/span&gt;. It was also Leek and colleagues that decided to look at RNA-seq data in a manner less dependent on potentially incomplete gene annotation. With the increase in size of RNA-seq projects, they thought it would be feasible to assess the differential expression signal at base pair resolution in an approach called differentially expressed regions (DER) finder &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Frazee et al. 2014)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around then that I started to work with Andrew Jaffe, who had RNA-seq data from the human brain. Jaffe and colleagues hypothesized that the gene annotation for the human brain might be incomplete and were interested in applying the DER finder approach to their data. With them, I modified the DER finder approach to make it computationally feasible to analyze these human brain samples at base resolution &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Jaffe et al. 2015)&lt;/span&gt;. We indeed found that the human brain transcriptome was not fully annotated and identified intronic DERs that were present in other brain datasets, including from mouse, and showed these regions were enriched for genetic risk for brain disorders. Further computational improvements to the DER finder approach yielded the &lt;em&gt;derfinder&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Collado-Torres, Nellore, Frazee, et al. 2017)&lt;/span&gt; Bioconductor &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Huber et al. 2015)&lt;/span&gt; package, reducing computing time from days to hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was working on &lt;em&gt;derfinder&lt;/em&gt;, Abhinav Nellore was developing &lt;em&gt;Rail-RNA&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Nellore, Collado-Torres, et al. 2016)&lt;/span&gt; with the goal of aligning large RNA-seq datasets. We determined that we only needed coverage data instead of alignments to use &lt;em&gt;derfinder&lt;/em&gt; and to perform gene level analyses. Coverage data files are much smaller than alignment files, which meant that we could greatly reduce our storage costs when using &lt;em&gt;Rail-RNA&lt;/em&gt; and allowed us to think as big as possible. Initially we looked at 21,504 human RNA-seq samples and explored the landscape of exon-exon junctions &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Nellore, Jaffe, et al. 2016)&lt;/span&gt;. The reads spanning exon-exon junctions provided by &lt;em&gt;Rail-RNA&lt;/em&gt; can be used for a second type of annotation-agnostic analysis as these reads provide information about exon skipping, alternative donor/acceptor sites and novel events. With a fairly conservative filter we determined that 18.6% of exon-exon junctions were missing in the annotation &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Nellore, Jaffe, et al. 2016)&lt;/span&gt;. This observation along with the fact that exon-exon junctions can be used to determine differential transcript usage gave strength to this second annotation-agnostic RNA-seq analysis method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers around the world have shared their raw data via the Sequence Read Archive or via large consortiums such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression study (GTEx) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, it still is complicated to align and compute count matrices for these datasets. We thought that if the public data was uniformly processed that we could make this large body of human expression data more reusable. We were well positioned to carry out this project and just needed resources. Luckily, Jeff Leek, Ben Langmead and others got together and funded the implementation of &lt;em&gt;Rail-RNA&lt;/em&gt; to analyze all the human public RNA-seq data available at the time, over 70,000 samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;fig:figure1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-20-scilifelab-prize-you-still-have-time-to-participate_files/figure1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Overview of the data available in recount2. Reads aligned to the reference genome can be used to compute a base pair coverage curve, identify exon-exon junctions and compute gene and exon count matrices. The reads spanning exon-exon junctions (jx) are used to compute a third count matrix that includes un-annotated junctions (jx 3 and 4). Annotation-agnostic expressed regions can be determined from the coverage data.&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;

Annotation-agnostic expressed regions can be determined from the coverage data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We computed gene count matrices for these 70,000 samples and made them available as the &lt;em&gt;recount2&lt;/em&gt; resource that can be accessed at &lt;a href=&#34;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/&#34;&gt;jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/&lt;/a&gt; as well as through the &lt;em&gt;recount&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Collado-Torres, Nellore, Kammers, et al. 2017)&lt;/span&gt; Bioconductor package, thus representing a major improvement over &lt;em&gt;ReCount&lt;/em&gt;. To take advantage of the data as much as possible, we also released exon and exon-exon junction count matrices as well as the coverage data files required for the DER finder approach, thus enabling both annotation-agnostic methods we developed that complement traditional methods. Figure 1 illustrates the type of information that is available via &lt;em&gt;recount2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I believe that &lt;em&gt;recount2&lt;/em&gt; will fuel the development of new analytical methods and greatly increase the usability of the public human gene expression data researchers have collected over the years. In the meantime, we are working hard on improving the data in &lt;em&gt;recount2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Ellis, Collado-Torres, and Leek 2017; Wilks et al. 2017)&lt;/span&gt; and exploring how to leverage results from different RNA-seq analytical approaches &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Jaffe et al. 2017)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ph.D. thesis abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonardo Collado-Torres’ thesis work is centered around the development of R software packages for analyzing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) high throughput genomic data. The first chapter describes the &lt;em&gt;derfinder&lt;/em&gt; Bioconductor package which implements the DER Finder approach for identifying differentially expressed regions with RNA-seq data in an annotation-agnostic manner. The second chapter shows how &lt;em&gt;derfinder&lt;/em&gt; can be applied to ChIP-seq data to identify differentially bounded regions. The third chapter describes the &lt;em&gt;regionReport&lt;/em&gt; Bioconductor package for producing HTML or PDF reports from region-based genomic analyses, such as the &lt;em&gt;derfinder&lt;/em&gt; analyses described in the previous chapters. The last thesis project Leonardo Collado-Torres carried out was the development of the &lt;em&gt;recount2&lt;/em&gt; resource and accompanying &lt;em&gt;recount&lt;/em&gt; Bioconductor package using the &lt;em&gt;Rail-RNA&lt;/em&gt; results from processing all the public human RNA-seq data at the time, which spans over 70,000 samples.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Slack for Academic Departmental Communication</title>

      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/19/using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a joint blog post between &lt;a href=&#34;http://stephaniehicks.com&#34;&gt;Stephanie Hicks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/&#34;&gt;Leonardo Collado-Torres&lt;/a&gt;. We want to share with you our experience using Slack and why you should join us. This post is in an interview style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-19-using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication_files/slack-logo.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-slack&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Slack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[SH]&lt;/code&gt; Slack is a communication tool for &lt;em&gt;teams&lt;/em&gt;. The main idea is you have individual chat rooms (referred to as &lt;em&gt;channels&lt;/em&gt; that always begin with the # symbol), which are organized by topics. Traditionally, if an email is sent to everyone on your team, each person must decide how tag or organize emails in their account. In contrast, Slack provides the structure and organization for all users on the team. Each user clicks on a specific topic, or channel, and all the messages related to that topic are already there, thereby reducing the organizational burden. In a slack team used by academic department, topics can be anything from announcements of #conferences, #workshops, #jobs, #seminars, #working_groups, #good_reads, #food_alerts, #payroll, and #IT_help. You can write public messages in the individual channels or send private direct messages to anyone on your team. Everything in Slack is searchable (e.g. files, conversations, people). Finally, Slack includes a lot of functionality and integration with other useful tools such as Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-19-using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-19%20at%204.00.33%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[LCT]&lt;/code&gt; Slack is a website that provides access to a group of message channels bundled together in what they call a workspace. These channels can have specific purposes and different sets of members. Slack also provides many integrations with other software that we commonly use, like integration with GitHub, todo lists, Google Calendar, Google Docs, etc. The idea of using Slack is to keep your communications with close colleagues organized and make them more fluid than email. You might use the &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; channel for making broad announcements, such as an interesting talk from a guest. Then switch to a private channel with your 4 colleagues for that new secret project you are working on and discuss some ideas that would be useful to explore in more detail. And finally, switch to a one-on-one channel with your advisor and ask if you can meet for a few minutes that later today. Like many websites, Slack is also available as its own desktop and phone applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-you-use-slack&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do you use Slack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[SH]&lt;/code&gt; While I communicate with colleagues everyday on Slack, I think it’s important to distinguish between Slack and email. Both are important, I just use them for different purposes. I view communication on Slack to be for instant, real-time messaging and discussion to increase collaboration. These are usually short messages compassing a single idea. In contrast, I view email to be a slower, more deliberate medium. There is less expectation for immediate response. In both cases, you can always turn them off completely and enjoy some peace too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-19-using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-19%20at%204.04.08%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;versus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-19-using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-19%20at%204.04.18%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[LCT]&lt;/code&gt; I’m part of multiple Slack &lt;em&gt;workplaces&lt;/em&gt; (collections of channels and users) but I mostly use one with my genomics collaborators. There, we have a channel per project, some of which can be silent for weeks/months. But that’s ok, because I can always jump back to them and revise what we were talking about. We have a channel for R questions, one for the team that I’m a part of (Andrew Jaffe’s lab), one for organizing when and where to eat lunch, another one with the recount2 team, a diversity channel, one for our computing cluster JHPCE, among others. I also frequently ask and get asked questions on one-on-one channels with Andrew’s lab members and people elsewhere from our genomics workplace. I love using Twitter for networking in academia and keeping myself updated. So I also tend to share relevant news to specific channels I’m a part of. For the project specific channels I also use the integration with GitHub to keep everything in one place and reduce the chance of git merge issues :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-do-you-like-about-slack&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do you like about Slack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[SH]&lt;/code&gt; I recently transitioned from being a postdoctoral research fellow to an assistant professor. Many people warned me about the increase in the number of emails that I would receive. While that is certainly true, I would attribute Slack to being the biggest mitigator in reducing the number of emails that I have received. It reduces my email burden and increases communication between collaborators and colleagues. When an email sometimes seems too formal, Slack is &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for sending out quick messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[LCT]&lt;/code&gt; It greatly reduces the amount of emails and email chains. Also, I like having the option of more communication with all my colleagues than would be typically allowed via email. Like no one would like an email about some interesting R package tweet or emails about lunch. Also, it was very useful this past year when I advised two students. I could get them involved in different projects, get them observe how we do some things, but also provide them a space to ask me questions during the week outside of our weekly meeting slot. Ultimately, I like to be organized and Slack helps me stay organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;any-more-tips&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Any more tips?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[SH]&lt;/code&gt; I have found that the more I engage and write messages in channels on a Slack team, the more I get in return. As conversations flow in a given channel on a particular topic, I may or may not have anything useful to contribute. If it’s the former, I try to pass along links, advice, knowledge or whatever is appropriate. If it’s the latter, I still gain knowledge by being able to read other people’s responses and learning how others would have approached or solved a problem. Either way it’s a win-win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[LCT]&lt;/code&gt; Regardless of what channel you use, it’s important to keep your messages polite. Basically, following a code of conduct similar to &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/#coc&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. This is not the anonymous internet, here you are interacting with your colleagues and you have to be aware of biases you might have, otherwise you might perpetrate some problems &lt;a href=&#34;https://work.qz.com/1128150/your-companys-slack-is-probably-sexist/&#34;&gt;like sexism&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, you share the responsibility of making sure that your Slack workspace is a welcoming environment where anyone is allowed to ask questions. I also think that it’s very important to keep your boundaries clear between work and home. I highly recommend going to your &lt;em&gt;preferences&lt;/em&gt; and automatically disabling notifications outside work hours as shown below. That’s something you can’t do with Google Chat: yes, I might be available after work hours, but I want to choose whether to respond or not and I don’t want others to expect an immediate answer if they see me online.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mindfulness</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/11/mindfulness/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/11/mindfulness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently participated for the first time in a silent retreat (6 hrs) as part of a &lt;em&gt;Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction&lt;/em&gt; course. I’ve really been enjoying this course and the experience of learning new ways (for me) to live better and enjoy life more. If you haven’t heard of &lt;em&gt;mindfulness&lt;/em&gt; before (like me a few months ago), &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; defines it as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one&amp;#39;s attention to
experiences occurring in the present moment, which can be developed
through the practice of meditation and other training.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In academia and science, but really anywhere, we can encounter many sources of stress (some examples below). We all deal with it in different ways and this MBSR course is just one that I’m liking right now and recommend. If there’s no course near you, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C4BA3UK&#34;&gt;Full Catastrophe Living&lt;/a&gt; book that my course is based on&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these tweets are threads, so you’ll have to open them to see them: click on the blue bird on the right side of each tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Thanks for sharing this Ted! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tladeras?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@tladeras&lt;/a&gt; As with anything, but particularly with mental health, I think it’s important to know you are not alone and that some things we feel have names: impostor syndrome, anxiety, depression, etc. Our minds are very powerful! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MentalHealthMatters?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#MentalHealthMatters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/X1UIAznV8f&#34;&gt;https://t.co/X1UIAznV8f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; L. Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1004478330257707008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the exercises on our silent retreat was &lt;em&gt;mindful eating&lt;/em&gt;. That is, eating slowly and focusing on our senses while eating food. This involved smelling the food, seeing all the colors it has, feeling all the different textures, and focusing on its taste. Plus, not talking to anyone. I had bought a lunch before the retreat (so I wouldn’t have to break the silence during it) that I normally don’t find interesting: some fruit and a chicken curry wrap from CVS. But wow, it was amazing that day! I greatly enjoyed how it tasted and all the different sensations I felt. I couldn’t believe it was the same food I had eaten other times before without much excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been processing some strong feelings related to feeling unwelcome, homesickness and loneliness. I’m doing many things that I know help me, starting with talking about them with my family. I’ve also been keeping myself busy doing some sports outside, going to events, bars, having friends over, etc. But what motivated me to write this post today is that after lunch I left really bad today. I had to go outside and try to calm myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-11-mindfulness_files/2018-06-11_13.25.34.jpg&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I did, returned to work, and nah, I couldn’t do it today. So I went home, rested in my room in the dark, and I find myself finishing this post about 2 hours later. I’m not sure it’s related to the MSBR course, but I’m wondering if the mindfulness practice is also opening my mind’s ears and eyes to my inner feelings way more than normal&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t think it’s bad. It’s just that it’s way harder to enjoy this process than it was eating a lunch. I’m trying to feel happy because I have feelings and I’m recognizing them. My family is also happy because they view it as a part of maturing and that I’m getting ready for taking another step in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just some things are taking me way more time than normal. For example, it took me 2 days to process what I wanted to reply to a tweet and how to word it: it turned out well because I think we all heard each other ^^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Thanks for the link &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@apreshill&lt;/a&gt;! I agree that the blog post was aweful! You can’t blame X for the fact that X is marginalized. However, I disagree with the notion that Z can’t talk about X (challenging). I’m in favor of inclusion. Otherwise that line of thought leads to xenophobia&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; L. Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1006207918813958145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also discovered that the silent retreat reminded me of vacations where I turn off my phone/email and spend a few days thinking about what’s next. I used to go to Mexico every 6 months or so during my PhD to recharge. I want to do it again, but I can’t. That lead me to my strong feelings of homesickness I had today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to close, I’m OK. I appreciate all the support I have and I recommend others to learn about mindfulness. You might be missing out some super tasty lunches and/or an exploration trip towards your inner self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to add that I know some of you might see this post as over-sharing (yes, it might be). One reply is that I think that leaders also have to show their vulnerable sides. This has been debated a lot in academic twitter accounts in the context of showing your failures too, not just your successes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Friday 7pm and it’s been a long week with ups and downs&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But I’m enthused as I write this blog post. In less than a month from now I’ll be attending &lt;a href=&#34;http://unconf18.ropensci.org/&#34;&gt;rOpenSci unconf18&lt;/a&gt; and it’ll be my first time at this type of event. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Building on my streak of good news, I&amp;#39;m delighted to have been selected to attend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rOpenSci?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@rOpenSci&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unconf18?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#Unconf18&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/Xe6lojB7TS&#34;&gt;https://t.co/Xe6lojB7TS&lt;/a&gt; ^_^ Also, thanks to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/o5OwUWEaBD&#34;&gt;https://t.co/o5OwUWEaBD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LieberInstitute?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@LieberInstitute&lt;/a&gt; for their support! I&amp;#39;m hoping to relay as much as I can to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LIBDrstats?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@LIBDrstats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; L. Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/983876013015826432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my self introduction to everyone attending, I mentioned that I don’t use the pipe (&lt;code&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) symbol and that I use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/code&gt; for assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-04-27-getting-ready-to-attend-ropensci-unconf18-and-probably-working-on-tidyverse-like-functions-for-the-first-time_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-27%20at%207.11.14%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt; Recently I had my pre-unconf chat with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ropensci.org/about/#team&#34;&gt;Stefanie Butland&lt;/a&gt; (read more about these chats &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.trelliscience.com/the-value-of-welcome-part-2-how-to-prepare-40-new-community-members-for-an-unconference/&#34;&gt;in her great blog post&lt;/a&gt;). In my notes to Stefanie before our chat I had mentioned again my lack of R piping experience and we talked about it. As we talked, it became clear that a blog post on related topics would be useful. Sure, I could have asked directly to the other unconf18 participants, but maybe others from the R community in general can chime in or benefit from reading the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;coding-style-and-git&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coding style and git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m attending unconf18 with an open mind and I think of myself as someone who can be quite flexible (not with my body!) and accommodating. I’m assuming that most participants at unconf18 will use &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for assignment. I’m not looking to start any discussions about the different assignment operators. Simply, I am willing to use whatever the majority uses. Just like I did in my first pull request to the &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; package (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/pull/263&#34;&gt;issue 263&lt;/a&gt;). I was trying to follow Yihui Xie’s coding style to make his life easier and have a clean (or cleaner) git history. From &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name/en/2018/02/bite-sized-pull-requests/&#34;&gt;Yihui’s post on this pull request&lt;/a&gt; I can see that he liked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping this in mind, I think that following the coding style of others will be something I’ll do at unconf18. I haven’t really worked in any R packages with many developers actively working on the package. But I imagine that setting a common coding style will minimize git conflicts, and &lt;strong&gt;no one&lt;/strong&gt; wants those&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know if we’ll all follow some common guidelines at unconf18. I actually imagine that it’ll be project-specific. Why? Well because you can create an R project in RStudio&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and set some defaults for the project such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the number of spaces for tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;line ending conversions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-04-27-getting-ready-to-attend-ropensci-unconf18-and-probably-working-on-tidyverse-like-functions-for-the-first-time_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-27%20at%207.27.27%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also set some global RStudio preferences like whether to &lt;em&gt;auto-indent code after paste&lt;/em&gt;, length of lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-04-27-getting-ready-to-attend-ropensci-unconf18-and-probably-working-on-tidyverse-like-functions-for-the-first-time_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-27%20at%207.28.49%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt; Additionally, we can decide whether we’ll use the RStudio “wand” to &lt;em&gt;reformat code&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-04-27-getting-ready-to-attend-ropensci-unconf18-and-probably-working-on-tidyverse-like-functions-for-the-first-time_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-27%20at%207.31.29%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe all of this is unnecessary, maybe everyone will work in different non-overlapping functions and thus avoid git conflicts. For example, at my job sometimes I write code with &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; users, but we don’t work on the same lines of the code file. Later on it becomes easy to identify who wrote which line without having to use &lt;code&gt;git blame&lt;/code&gt; (awful name, right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;tidyverse-like-functions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tidyverse-like functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I think that these coding style issues are minor and will be easily dealt with. I think that we’ll all be able to adapt and instead focus on other problems (like whatever the package is trying to solve) and enjoy the experience (network, build &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; as Stefanie put it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second concern has to do with something I imagine could require more effort: my homework before the unconf. That is, writing tidyverse-like functions. Like I’ve said, I haven’t used the R pipe &lt;code&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code&gt; symbol. I’ve executed some code with it before, seeing it in many blog posts, but I’ve never actually written functions designed to be compatible with this type of logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I help write a function that is not pipe-friendly, then it might not integrate nicely with other functions written by the rest of the team. It would lead to workarounds in the vignette or maybe having someone else re-factor my first function to make it pipe-friendly. Sure, I would learn from observing others make changes to my code. But I want to take advantage as much as I can from my experience at rOpenSci unconf&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t really use &lt;code&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, I’m unfamiliar with many things related to pipe-friendly (tidyverse-like) functions. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you document them differently? Like make a single Rd file for multiple functions. Or do you make an Rd file per function even if the example usage doesn’t involve &lt;code&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know that the first argument is important in pipe-friendly functions. But I ignore if the second and other arguments play a role or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do people use the ellipsis (&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;) argument in pipe-friendly functions? With my &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder&#34;&gt;derfinder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; package I ended up a very deep rabbit hole using &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;. I explained some of the logic in my &lt;code&gt;dots&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2014/12/11/dots/#.WuO4-VMvy50&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; (there are fair criticisms to going deep with &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; in the comments).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you write unit tests for pipe-friendly functions? Similar to how you write documentation for them, do the unit tests just test one function a time or do they test several at a time (that is the output after using &lt;code&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code&gt;)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These and other questions could involve time getting familiar with. Time that I could spend now, before unconf18, learning and at least getting a better sense of what to expect. Maybe I’m complicating myself and worrying too much about this. I imagine that the solution will involve a combination of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking some popular tidyverse packages that use &lt;code&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code&gt;. Like the vignettes/README files and examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading more about this in a book(s): I don’t know which one though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing around a bit as a user with some of these functions. See what error messages pop up: actually I don’t know how users debug a series of functions tied together via &lt;code&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying everyone should learn about these topics before unconf18. I think that we are all (well, maybe excluding some) worried about not knowing &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;travis&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;testthat&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;usethis&lt;/code&gt;/etc topic before unconf18. And that will part of why it’ll be great to meet everyone in what is known to be an extremely welcoming R conference ^^ (seriously, check &lt;a href=&#34;https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/02/unconf2017/&#34;&gt;all the unconf17 posts&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling welcomed can be hard… oh well.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could talk about git for a long time too. But I hope that I’ll get by with some git push, git pull, and maybe git branch.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the sponsors &lt;a href=&#34;http://unconf18.ropensci.org/#sponsors&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://unconf18.ropensci.org/#sponsors&lt;/a&gt; and well, probably want most will be using since it has such nice tools for writing R packages.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specially since most only attend one unconf, I think. So it’s different from other conferences that you can experience multiple years and network with the group across a longer period of time: that’s what I’ve done with the Bioconductor meetings.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/04/19/latin-american-r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/04/19/latin-american-r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’m excited to invite you to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.comunidadbioinfo.org/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34;&gt;Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018&lt;/a&gt;! It’ll be held in Cuernavaca, Mexico from July 30th to August 3rd, 2018. You can find the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/p/108108&#34;&gt;official announcement in the Bioconductor support website&lt;/a&gt;. Let me share with you why I’m excited about this workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2017/BioC2017/&#34;&gt;BioC2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://alejandroreyes.org/&#34;&gt;Alejandro Reyes&lt;/a&gt; and I talked for a while about the low representation of Latin Americans through out the years that either of us have attended the BioC meetings&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We wanted to see more Latin faces in person but also in the Bioconductor Support Website and among package contributors. We brainstormed for a while and a at dinner with Bioconductor core members we simply ran with our ideas: we brought up the subject and were pleasantly rewarded with support from the Bioconductor team (Alejandro did most of the convincing!). That is, if we organized a conference/workshop, they would help us by sending someone to be one of the instructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Alejandro and I had already discussed why we like the Bioc meetings so much. One of the keys is that the Bioc meetings have always had events for different levels of R users. That is, you can attend the conference each year and learn something new (that’s how I got my career started). So you can progress from learning R, to mastering several R packages, to contributing R packages to Bioconductor, to brainstorming future directions for the Bioconductor project&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the Bioc meetings have scientific talks in the mornings so that you can learn new scientific and R developments in a single conference. We’ve seen this model adapted in other Bioc events like BiocAsia, the European Bioconductor Meeting, etc. It would be ideal if we got to that point, but we wanted to start smaller with a focus on developing R packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/heladia-salgado-bb122954/&#34;&gt;Heladia Salgado&lt;/a&gt;, Romualdo Zayas and others from CCG-UNAM&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and NNB-UNAM&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have organized the &lt;a href=&#34;http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/&#34;&gt;“Talleres Internacionales de Bioinformática”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (TIBs) for years now. Actually, I was a student in 2006 and gave a lecture in the summer 2010 event. At the TIBs they’ve had an introductory R class for a few years now where &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/selenefernandez/&#34;&gt;Selene Fernandez-Valverde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://liigh.unam.mx/amedina/&#34;&gt;Alejandra Medina-Rivera&lt;/a&gt; have participated as instructors. Among the feedback they’ve received is the desire for a more advanced R course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alejandro and I talked to Alejandra Medina-Rivera who shared our enthusiasm for Bioconductor. As a PI in Mexico, Alejandra knows very well how sparse are the R/Bioconductor courses that she can send her students to. By the way, Alejandra is the one who first invited me to attend BioC2008!&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We quickly started an email thread with Heladia and basically, the pieces started to fall in the right places. Heladia, Delfino Garcia-Alonso, Daniela Ledezma, Laura Gómez, Shirley Alquicira, Thalia Uranga Martínez, among others have been instrumental in organizing the workshop. Heladia, Alejandra and others also secured crucial funding from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ccg.unam.mx/&#34;&gt;CCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://liigh.unam.mx/&#34;&gt;LIIGH-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;. Together we were able to invite and get all the logistics so that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.roswellpark.org/martin-morgan&#34;&gt;Martin Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heatherturner.net/&#34;&gt;Heather Turner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.somos.unicamp.br/professores/view/4722&#34;&gt;Benilton Carvalho&lt;/a&gt;, Selene Fernandez-Valverde, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.teresa-ortiz.com/eng&#34;&gt;María Teresa Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mastrettayanes-lab.org/&#34;&gt;Alicia Mastretta Yanes&lt;/a&gt; could all help us teach part of the workshop and/or present their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, these are some of the reasons why they are amazing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martin: Bioconductor project leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heather: extensive experience teaching R and bioinformatics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benilton: he helped organize a similar workshop in 2015: &lt;a href=&#34;http://lab.foundation/&#34;&gt;LAb Foundation Brasil&lt;/a&gt;. Also an academic relative of Alejandro and myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selene: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fondationloreal.com/categories/for-women-in-science/lang/en&#34;&gt;L’Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science&lt;/a&gt;, has taught at TIBs before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/rladiescdmx/&#34;&gt;RLadiesCDMX&lt;/a&gt; plus just look at her awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tereom?tab=repositories&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; profile!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alicia: she has taught an intro to bioinformatics and reproducible genetic analyses course, plus check her &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AliciaMstt?tab=repositories&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; profile!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you check the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.comunidadbioinfo.org/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34;&gt;workshop schedule&lt;/a&gt; we have, you’ll notice that we will have several sessions devoted to actually writing R packages. So the course will cover both the theory and the practice side of things. If you attend the workshop, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to network with your peers and to learn from other R developers. You should be super excited now!! ^^ Plus we have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ComunidadBioInfo/R-BioConductor-Developers-Workshop-2018/blob/master/R-Bioconductor-2018_Program.rmd#code-of-conduct&#34;&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt; (en &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.comunidadbioinfo.org/codigo-de-conducta/&#34;&gt;Español&lt;/a&gt;) to ensure that the conference will be welcoming to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a reminder that you have to keep trying. Back in 2009 or 2010 I had gotten an offer of support from Bioc for sending someone to Cuernavaca, but due to funding circumstances it fell through. Like I said, all the pieces fell in the right places this time. Plus Heladia Salgado has made it all possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 is looking like a good year for R courses in Latin America. For example, there’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://latin-r.com/en&#34;&gt;LatinR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/&#34;&gt;Buenos Aires RLadies&lt;/a&gt; plus our workshop! Fingers crossed, I’ll be able to attend the workshop in 2019!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I’m excited to invite you to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.comunidadbioinfo.org/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34;&gt;Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018&lt;/a&gt;! Regardless of whether you can attend it, help us spread the word:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bioc team has been great about financially supporting newcomers! I was one of them: just remember to apply before the deadline expires!&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be in that order. For example, anyone attending the Bioc meeting is welcome at the Developer’s Day and to chime in the discussions about the Bioconductor project.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centro de Ciencias Genómicas: Center for Genomic Sciences&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nodo Nacional de Bioinformática: National Bioinformatics Node&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internacional Bioinformatics Workshops&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn6&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then taught a few courses at LCG-UNAM, CCG-UNAM and IBT-UNAM from 2008 to 2011 with some slides in Spanish and English. Alejandro was my TA for one of these courses! For a few years since then I would get emails in Spanish asking about some of those courses. You can still find those courses online, but I bet that the material is outdated. In any case, it’s another example of the limited training opportunities.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref6&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/03/08/blogdown-archetype-template/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent blog post I &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/02/17/r-markdown-blog-template/#.WqDOdpPwa50&#34;&gt;wrote about having a template&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; posts. I wanted to know if it was possible to do this and make my life (and others hopefully) easier for writing new blog posts that are ready to go with the features I frequently re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I like using &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocStyle&#34;&gt;BiocStyle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Oles_2017&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocStyle&#39;&gt;Oleś, Morgan, and Huber, 2017&lt;/a&gt;) for functions such as &lt;code&gt;CRANpkg()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Biocpkg()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Githubpkg()&lt;/code&gt;. I also like using &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitcitations&#34;&gt;knitcitations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Boettiger_2017&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitcitations&#39;&gt;Boettiger, 2017&lt;/a&gt;) for citing with &lt;code&gt;citep()&lt;/code&gt; packages or papers; I use &lt;code&gt;citation()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bib_metadata()&lt;/code&gt; to get the necessary information, respectively. Furthermore, I prefer &lt;code&gt;devtools::session_info()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Wickham_2018&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools&#39;&gt;Wickham, Hester, and Chang, 2018&lt;/a&gt;) over &lt;code&gt;sessionInfo()&lt;/code&gt; since it provides information of where you got the package, which becomes specially relevant when using packages from GitHub. Finally, I like thanking the creators of the tools I use, which in this case is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Xie_2017&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#39;&gt;Xie, Hill, and Thomas, 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like reminding myself how to do some common tasks. Basically, the equivalent of the new R Markdown file you get when using RStudio. In my case, I want to remind myself of the YAML options I frequently use (toc, fig height and width) or how to add screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/02/17/r-markdown-blog-template/#.WqDOdpPwa50&#34;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; on this topic is actually rather messy. That’s because at that time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn’t know about &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/&#34;&gt;hugo archetypes&lt;/a&gt; which are &lt;em&gt;template&lt;/em&gt; files,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hadn’t even thought of making the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/03/07/blogdown-insert-image-addin/#.WqDRmpPwa50&#34;&gt;Insert Image addin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went down the rabbit hole of archetypes and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, reported an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/261&#34;&gt;issue resulated to this topic&lt;/a&gt; that was in the way of using archetypes for &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; posts. After some encouragement by Yihui Xie, I ended up fixing this issues in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/pull/263&#34;&gt;my first pull request&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; to an RStudio package. The PR also added the &lt;code&gt;Archetype&lt;/code&gt; option to the &lt;em&gt;New Post&lt;/em&gt; RStudio addin (which I used right now ^^).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-03-08-blogdown-archetype-template_files/Screen Shot 2018-03-08 at 1.05.13 AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;new post addin with archetype option&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;creating-my-blogdown-archetype-template&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating my &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; archetype (template)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make my archetype (template) for blog posts I looked at the GitHub repo for the theme I’m using. It contains an &lt;code&gt;archetypes&lt;/code&gt; directory with several files. I just looked at the one called &lt;code&gt;post.md&lt;/code&gt; (check it &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/archetypes/post.md&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and copied it from &lt;code&gt;themes/hugo-academic/archetypes/post.md&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;archetypes/post.md&lt;/code&gt;. Next I added my favorite R code below the last &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; mark. You can check out the final version &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lcolladotor/hugoblog/blob/master/archetypes/post.md&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Below I display the version at the time of writing this blog post (I’m using a &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; extension otherwise the embedded gist doesn’t look good, but you want it to end in &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/lcolladotor/c3e141e033306299d0946a76e71f2967.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t get the archetype to respect some of the YAML that &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; adds, but well, that’s a single copy-paste I have to do now (if I actually decide to use the custom YAML options which are only for &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; posts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to make your own &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; archetype (template). At least it should remind you to include reproducibility information which matters whenever any R code is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>blogdown Insert Image addin</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/03/07/blogdown-insert-image-addin/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/03/07/blogdown-insert-image-addin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried inserting an image into a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; post? Maybe you have, or maybe you tried and gave up. Lets first review the &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; way before getting to the solution I contributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-hard-way&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process involves copying the target image to the static directory that corresponds to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; post. Lets say that your post is called &lt;code&gt;2018-03-07-my-new-post.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; and lives at &lt;code&gt;content/post/&lt;/code&gt;, so it’s full path is &lt;code&gt;content/post/2018-03-07-my-new-post.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;. When you run the RStudio &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; addin &lt;em&gt;Serve Site&lt;/em&gt;, behind curtains the directory &lt;code&gt;static/post/2018-03-07-my-new-post_files&lt;/code&gt; is created and inside it you can find the images made by your R code: likely at &lt;code&gt;static/post/2018-03-07-my-new-post_files/figure_html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far everything is working! But now you want to add a screenshot or some other image to your blog post. Lets say that your image is &lt;code&gt;~/Desktop/screenshot.jpg&lt;/code&gt;. Your &lt;code&gt;~/Desktop&lt;/code&gt; directory is not part of your &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; directory and well, simply put, your website won’t find the image. We need to put it in a location that will be made public by &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;. That is, we need to put it inside &lt;code&gt;static/post/2018-03-07-my-new-post_files&lt;/code&gt; (or anywhere inside &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;, but we like to keep things tidy!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so we copy our screenshot file &lt;code&gt;~/Desktop/screenshot.jpg&lt;/code&gt; and save it as &lt;code&gt;static/post/2018-03-07-my-new-post_files/screenshot.jpg&lt;/code&gt;. The next time we render our site and publish it, the figure will be available in the web. But it’s still not part of our &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we need to use either the Markdown or HTML syntax for adding the image. Maybe your initial thought is to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;![](screenshot.jpg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that &lt;strong&gt;will not&lt;/strong&gt; work. We need to use almost all the path (just remove &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;) as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;![](/post/2018-03-07-my-new-post_files/screenshot.jpg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to edit the height or width, then you need to use the HTML syntax. Something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img alt = &amp;#39;my new screenshot&amp;#39; width=&amp;#39;200&amp;#39; src=&amp;#39;/post/2018-03-07-my-new-post_files/screenshot.jpg&amp;#39; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;hard-way-notes&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;hard way&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could have also used &lt;code&gt;knitr::include_graphics()&lt;/code&gt; and let &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; copy it to the final location in &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; and link to it appropriately. However, you would have to keep your original images organized in a way that won’t bother &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option that I used for a while, even in the days when my blog was based on Jekyll, is to render the figures yourself and copy the directory with the figures, plus mess around with how they are linked from R. Details &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lcolladotor/markdown-redcarpet.tmbundle/commit/f043c056ff620299843e9d8ea34144f478aa7965&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Not something I recommend doing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;insert-image-addin-aka-the-easy-way&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insert Image&lt;/em&gt; addin: aka, the &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, you most likely (you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; if you can) are using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt; and the great &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; addins: &lt;em&gt;New Post&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Serve Site&lt;/em&gt;. I just recently started using them in the past few days and looking at the code I realized that it should be possible to make an addin that lets you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select a target image,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copies the target image to the appropriate location under &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gives you the correct code for linking the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yihui Xie &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/269&#34;&gt;loved the idea&lt;/a&gt; (I think it’s fair to say that ^^) and helped me polish it in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/pull/272&#34;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; that implements it. He then refined the code even &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/commit/7355a94edc62dd9ffe3792c1103f1536b9c67406&#34;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;features-of-the-insert-image-addin&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Features of the &lt;em&gt;Insert Image&lt;/em&gt; addin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final features, at least as implemented in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; version 0.5.7 are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select an image from anywhere in your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically generate a candidate final location for your image under &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;, which you can edit. Useful if you want to rename the final figure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow specifying the alternate description of the image (&lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt;), height and width.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the target image file exists, a dynamic menu shows up that asks you whether to overwrite it or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final syntax is Markdown unless a width or height are used, in which case it uses HTML code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yihui Xie &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/pull/272&#34;&gt;hinted&lt;/a&gt; at other possible future features, which maybe you can help implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;using-the-insert-image-addin&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using the &lt;em&gt;Insert Image&lt;/em&gt; addin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;step-1-install-appropriate-blogdown-version&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 1: install appropriate &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; version&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, at the time of writing this post, you need the development version of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. You can install it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Check if you have version 0.5.7 or newer
## I actually used version 0.5.9 for this blog post
packageVersion(&amp;#39;blogdown&amp;#39;)

## If not, then get it!
##### If necessary:
## install.packages(&amp;#39;devtools&amp;#39;)
devtools::install_github(&amp;#39;rstudio/blogdown&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also need an up to date version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt; and I recommend also using &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;R 3.4.x&lt;/a&gt; (or newer if you are reading this in the future). Re-start RStudio so it loads the new version of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;step-2-open-the-insert-image-addin&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 2: open the &lt;em&gt;Insert Image&lt;/em&gt; addin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, go to the &lt;em&gt;Addins&lt;/em&gt; menu in the top section of the RStudio window and select the &lt;em&gt;Insert Image&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; addin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-03-07-blogdown-insert-image-addin_files/Screen Shot 2018-03-07 at 11.47.37 PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;insert image addin screenshot&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;step-3-choose-figure-and-inputs&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 3: choose figure and inputs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the &lt;em&gt;Insert Image&lt;/em&gt; addin looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-03-07-blogdown-insert-image-addin_files/Screen Shot 2018-03-07 at 11.58.44 PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;addin without input&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets go head and select an image we want to upload. In my case, I chose an image that already exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-03-07-blogdown-insert-image-addin_files/Screen Shot 2018-03-08 at 12.00.01 AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can rename the figure if you want, and if it doesn’t exist, the &lt;em&gt;overwrite&lt;/em&gt; option goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-03-07-blogdown-insert-image-addin_files/Screen Shot 2018-03-08 at 12.01.06 AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;modified image file&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;step-4-hit-done&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 4: hit done!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-03-07-blogdown-insert-image-addin_files/Screen Shot 2018-03-08 at 12.02.28 AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;hit go&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets go ahead and click &lt;code&gt;done&lt;/code&gt;! Our text window in RStudio will insert the appropriate code for linking the image. In this case, it’s the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/post/2018-03-07-blogdown-insert-image-addin_files/screenshot.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;final image&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;400&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this is the image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-03-07-blogdown-insert-image-addin_files/screenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;final image&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;optional-step-5&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Optional step 5&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now use the &lt;em&gt;Serve Site&lt;/em&gt; addin and check if you like your images. You might want to change the height/widths or alternate text. You could also wrap the HTML/Markdown code around it for linking to a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also delete your original images, if for example, they are cluttering your &lt;code&gt;~/Desktop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you will find this new addin as useful as I’m finding it, or even more. Plus hopefully this blog post gives you an idea of the difficulties before this addin existed. Also, I want to thank Yihui Xie for guiding me, I’ve learnt quite a bit recently. Though I will still use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/code&gt; assignment operator for my own code hehe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>R markdown blog template</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/02/17/r-markdown-blog-template/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/02/17/r-markdown-blog-template/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post is mostly for myself but maybe it’s useful to others. It contains my current R markdown blog template. I initially posted this as a question at &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48844340/is-it-possible-to-create-a-rmd-file-template-for-the-blogdown-new-post-addin&#34;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;. Then I read how much a burden we put in &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name/en/2018/02/career-crisis/&#34;&gt;Yihui Xie&lt;/a&gt; and decided that my current setup (copy-pasting) works just fine. In any case using &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; with the RStudio IDE is much simpler than what I used to do in the past with &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/11/09/new-Fellgernon-Bit-setup-in-Github/&#34;&gt;jekyll&lt;/a&gt; or with even my prior &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/42&#34;&gt;setup with blogdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bibliography-setup&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bibliography setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I define the citation information I’ll need. By the way, I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name/knitr/faq/&#34;&gt;FAQ 7&lt;/a&gt; for showing the R code chunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ```{r bibsetup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    ## Load knitcitations with a clean bibliography
    library(&amp;#39;knitcitations&amp;#39;)
    cleanbib()
    cite_options(hyperlink = &amp;#39;to.doc&amp;#39;, citation_format = &amp;#39;text&amp;#39;, style = &amp;#39;html&amp;#39;)
    
    bib &amp;lt;- c(&amp;#39;knitcitations&amp;#39; = citation(&amp;#39;knitcitations&amp;#39;),
             &amp;#39;blogdown&amp;#39; = citation(&amp;#39;blogdown&amp;#39;)[2])
    ```&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;post-content&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I typically start to edit since the bibliography chunk is hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;r-image&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;R image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ```{r &amp;#39;plot&amp;#39;}
    ## This will create the /post/*_files/ directory
    ## where you can later copy the non-R images you want to use
    ## in the blog post
    plot(1:10, 10:1)
    ```&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-02-17-r-markdown-blog-template_files/figure-html/plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I modified the YAML portion of the post to set the figure width and height. You can also include a table of contents if you want, though it affects the summary of the post. Check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html&#34;&gt;output format&lt;/a&gt; section of the &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; book for more details &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Xie_2017&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#39;&gt;Xie, Hill, and Thomas, 2017&lt;/a&gt;), including differences between &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.Rmarkdown&lt;/code&gt; files. Note that you can also use a &lt;code&gt;_output.yml&lt;/code&gt; file as described there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;output:
  blogdown::html_page:
    toc: no
    fig_width: 5
    fig_height: 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;custom-image-syntax&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Custom image syntax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I remind myself of different ways I can include external images. Check &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/239&#34;&gt;blogdown issue 239&lt;/a&gt; for some background information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown syntax for custom image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;![](/post/2018-02-17-r-markdown-blog-template_files/LIBD.jpg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-02-17-r-markdown-blog-template_files/LIBD.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML syntax for centering image, including a link, and re-sizing the image to a fix width of 200 px.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://lcolladotor.github.io/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt = &amp;#39;some website&amp;#39; width=&amp;#39;200&amp;#39; src=&amp;#39;/post/2018-02-17-r-markdown-blog-template_files/LIBD.jpg&amp;#39; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt = &#39;some website&#39; width=&#39;200&#39; src=&#39;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-02-17-r-markdown-blog-template_files/LIBD.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;reproducibility&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reproducibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Reproducibility info

      <title>Updating R</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2017/05/04/Updating-R/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2017/05/04/Updating-R/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As you might know by now, the latest R version was recently released (R 3.4.0). That means that you are &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; encouraged to update your R installation. There are several ways to do this some of which are documented in these other blog posts: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-statistics.com/2013/03/updating-r-from-r-on-windows-using-the-installr-package/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tal Galili, 2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.datascienceriot.com/how-to-upgrade-r-without-losing-your-packages/kris/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kris Eberwein, 2015&lt;/a&gt;. You would think that it&#39;s just a matter of downloading the latest R installer for your OS, installing it, and continuing your analysis. The reality is a bit more complicated. The following short steps will make your life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;save-your-list-of-currently-installed-packages&#34;&gt;Save your list of currently installed packages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to continue using R with all the packages you previously had installed, the best way is to save the list of packages you currently have before installing a new R version. You can do so with these lines of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Change accordingly
list_dir &amp;lt;- &#39;/Users/lcollado/Dropbox/Computing/R&#39;

## Get the list of installed packages
installed &amp;lt;- dir(.libPaths())

## Save the list for later use
save(installed, file = file.path(list_dir, paste0(Sys.Date(), &#39;-installed.Rdata&#39;)))

## Explore the list
head(installed)

## [1] &amp;quot;abind&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;acepack&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ada&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;AER&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;affy&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;affyio&amp;quot;

length(installed)

## [1] 611
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-latest-r&#34;&gt;Install latest R&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now you have a list of installed packages. It&#39;s like a restore point. Next, you need to get the latest R installer for your OS from &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt; and install the latest R. For example, for a Mac that would be &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.4.0.pkg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R-3.4.0.pkg&lt;/a&gt;. Install it as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;restore-your-packages&#34;&gt;Restore your packages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now you have a new R version installed but without all your favorite packages. So, how do you install them? You just need to open your latest list of installed packages and install them. Now, I&#39;m a Bioconductor user which means that some of my packages are not on CRAN. But the following code will work for you even if all the packages you use are from CRAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Change accordingly
list_dir &amp;lt;- &#39;/Users/lcollado/Dropbox/Computing/R&#39;

## Find the corresponding Rdata files
previous &amp;lt;- dir(path = list_dir, pattern = &#39;installed.Rdata&#39;)

## Load the latest one
load(file.path(list_dir, previous[length(previous)]))

## Just checking it
head(installed)

## [1] &amp;quot;abind&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;acepack&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ada&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;AER&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;affy&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;affyio&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, get the list of current R packages you have installed. Every new R installation comes with a few of them (the &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; packages). You don&#39;t need to install those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;current &amp;lt;- dir(.libPaths())
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, install the missing packages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## For Bioconductor and CRAN packages
source(&#39;http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R&#39;)
biocLite(installed[!installed %in% current])


## Bioconductor version 3.6 (BiocInstaller 1.27.2), ?biocLite for help
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and now you can continue on with your analysis 😄 You didn&#39;t even need to figure out the best order to install the packages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-packages&#34;&gt;GitHub packages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of your favorite R packages might only exist via GitHub. This list is likely short since most packages get distributed via CRAN. But if that&#39;s the case, you can see which packages are missing by running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Check which packages are missing
current_post_installation &amp;lt;- dir(.libPaths())
installed[!installed %in% current_post_installation]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in my case I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jalvesaq/colorout&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;colorout&lt;/a&gt; package which lives only in GitHub. I have to install that one manually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&#39;devtools&#39;)
library(&#39;devtools&#39;)
install_github(&amp;quot;jalvesaq/colorout&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other times a package might not be compiling for the new R version or might no longer be supported (defunct).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;misc-for-bioconductor-developers&#34;&gt;Misc for Bioconductor developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Bioconductor developer or are planning on becoming one, then you need 2 versions of R at all times. One R for the bioc-release branch and another one for the bioc-devel branch. Sometimes it&#39;s the same R version sometimes it&#39;s not depending on the month of the year. Right now, Bioc-release (3.5) uses R 3.4.0 and Bioc-devel (3.6) also uses R 3.4.0. &lt;a href=&#34;http://r.research.att.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R Switch&lt;/a&gt; for Mac users will be your friend. I can&#39;t find the old bioc-devel mailing list thread where I first learned this, but the idea is to download the latest R tar ball, change the name from 3.4 to something else (3.4devel in my case), put it back together into a tar ball and then use this tar ball to install a second R version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;## Download latest R tarball
wget http://r.research.att.com/el-capitan/R-3.4-branch/R-3.4-branch-el-capitan-sa-x86_64.tar.gz

## Un-tar it
tar -xvf R-3.4-branch-el-capitan-sa-x86_64.tar.gz

## Renamed files from 3.4 to 3.4 devel
mv Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4 Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4devel

## Put it back in a tar ball
tar -cvzf Rlib.tgz Library

## Install it
sudo tar fvxz Rlib.tgz -C /
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

      <description>

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr Please post your question at the Bioconductor support website &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://support.bioconductor.org/&lt;/a&gt; and check the posting guide &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s important that you provide reproducible code and information about your R session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been getting more questions about several packages I maintain. It&#39;s great to see more interest from users, but at the same time most questions lack the information I need to help the users. I have also gotten most of the questions via email, which is why I am writing this post. As of today, I will no longer answer questions related to my Bioconductor packages via personal emails. This might sound harsh, but hopefully the rest of this post will convince you that it&#39;s the best thing to do. You might also be interested in the basics of using &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/derfinder/inst/doc/derfinder-quickstart.html#basics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;derfinder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/regionReport/inst/doc/regionReport.html#basics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;regionReport&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/recount/inst/doc/recount-quickstart.html#basics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recount&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bioconductor project is a community project and it benefits from users interacting in public venues. When a user asks a question at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bioconductor support website&lt;/a&gt;, they are providing information that future users might be interested in. That is, the user (&lt;strong&gt;U1&lt;/strong&gt;) is contributing information to the overall documentation around the Bioconductor package they are asking a question about. Ideally, a new user (&lt;strong&gt;U2&lt;/strong&gt;) can then read through the question U1 wrote, check the solution, and move on. This is one of the main reasons why we (developers) want questions to be well documented. There are a couple of quick things that U1 can check that will make their question much more useful to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt = &#39;shinycsv landing&#39; width=&#39;600&#39; src=&#39;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2017-03-06-bioc-support/question.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;session-information&#34;&gt;Session information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the strengths of Bioconductor is that all the packages have vignettes and lots of documentation. The packages are also checked regularly and must pass some tests. That also means that packages can change frequently, at least more frequently than CRAN packages. There&#39;s also the added complexity that at any given point in time there is a release branch and a development branch. This means that there are many variables and saying that you are using the &amp;quot;latest version&amp;quot; doesn&#39;t mean much to the developer. All of this information and more is part of the &lt;em&gt;R session information&lt;/em&gt;. That is why I and others request users to post their session information. It&#39;s very easy to get, simply run the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Install devtools if needed
# install.packages(&#39;devtools&#39;)

## Reproducibility info
library(&#39;devtools&#39;)
options(width = 120)
session_info()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output might be too long to post in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bioconductor support website&lt;/a&gt;. The easy solution is to save the information you want displayed in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;. Then simply add the gist link in your question. Note that you need to have the link under &amp;quot;text&amp;quot; formatting and not &amp;quot;code&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-to-reproduce-the-error&#34;&gt;Code to reproduce the error&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If U1 includes the session information, their question will be pretty good, but not ideal yet. Many of the questions I&#39;ve been asked do not include code for me to figure out the exact steps of what they were doing. A lot of times I can infer pieces of what they were doing from their description of the problem. But doing so takes quite a bit of my time and effort, and is still not perfect. Now imagine that U2 is reading through the question: they would probably get lost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wide range of things that U1 could have done. To help the developer, the best thing is for the user to include the code that lead to the error. The code should include how the data was loaded, so that the developer can run it themselves and check in more detail what went wrong. This means providing a small subset of the data or using some publicly available data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that writing code that reproduces the error is not easy. But it helps a lot for learning more about R and Bioconductor. I can tell you that I went through the same process, and in my experience you can find out what you are doing wrong by writing the reproducible code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extra&#34;&gt;Extra&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other tips that are useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;traceback()&lt;/code&gt; immediately after getting the error and include the output in your question, that would be great. It makes it easier to check at what point the code failed and produced the error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently when I ask questions myself, I include the &amp;quot;non-evaluated code&amp;quot; (clean code in your script) and &amp;quot;evaluated code&amp;quot; (think of the R console: a mix of code and output). The non-evaluated code makes it easier for others to copy-paste the code into their R session without having to deal with any formatting issues (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/leekgroup/recount/issues/8#issue-210124094&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you encounter a new error, post a new question instead of &amp;quot;replying&amp;quot; to the first one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be polite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now you should be ready to post some great questions! Thanks for contributing to the Bioconductor community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr There is a 600 million to 2 billion USD annual market related to crossing the Mexico-US border. Allow temporary work visas (say 3 years) to take over this market and use the money to boost the US Border Patrol to build a wall of eyes, not a physical wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;President Trump of the United States of America,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cc President Peña Nieto of the United Mexican States&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Wednesday January 25th 2017, you are expected to announce your plans about building a wall between the United States and Mexico. I am opposed to building that wall but I also believe that providing alternatives is important when disagreeing. With that in mind, let me expose an alternative to your physical wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico has a net immigration rate of -1.7 migrants per 1,000 and a population of 123,166,749 individuals&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which means that about 209,000 people leave Mexico every year. The Department of Homeland Security 2014 report&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows that 350,177 out of 679,996 (51%) total aliens apprehended are from Mexico (52% reported elsewhere&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Many of the illegal immigrants pay people for helping them cross the Mexico-US border also known as &lt;em&gt;coyotes&lt;/em&gt;. Some informal surveys put the cost of a &lt;em&gt;coyote&lt;/em&gt; between 3,000 and 20,000 US dollars&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That means that there is an annual market worth about 627 to 1,050 million US dollars. This market exists and has been steady for years now. A physical wall in the Mexico-US border might not stop the illegal immigration to the US. Loss of jobs in Mexico directly related to your policies might even prompt more people to leave Mexico&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I believe that the high volume of people crossing the Mexico-US border makes it easier for drug cartels to hide and transport drugs. That is, it makes it harder for the US Border Patrol Agents to find who is transporting drugs and the track down the routes they use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what if the US took over this multi million dollar market? I have had the opportunity to visit countries that offer temporary work visas (ranging from 6 months to 3 years). The people interested in these visas have to pay a fee, pass a background check and sometimes go through health screenings. I believe that these immigrants pay the fee because it allows them to legally migrate, work for a while, save some money, and then go back to their home countries. From an immigrant&#39;s perspective, it must be very appealing to pay the same amount of money it cost to migrate safely and legally (for temporary work) than to attempt to cross the border illegally with the risk of dying in the process or getting kidnapped. Additionally, I think that temporary workers would feel much safer to go out of their homes while in the US, spending some of their hard earned money in the process and stimulating the local economy. They would be more likely to get a regular job where they would pay income taxes instead of getting payed &lt;em&gt;under the table&lt;/em&gt; and dodging the IRS. Furthermore, having the opportunity to legally go back home and visit family would be a huge advantage from an immigrant&#39;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing this letter I realized that the idea of &lt;em&gt;immigration tariffs&lt;/em&gt; is not new&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, I have not heard it being discussed recently and simply ask that you consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try to convince you that &lt;em&gt;immigration tariffs&lt;/em&gt; are an interesting alternative, consider what your government could do with an additional 600 to 1,000 million US dollars a year -- or multiply those numbers by two to get 1.2 to 2 billions USD a year by taking into account that about 50% of illegal immigrants are Mexicans. The average Border Patrol Agent self-reported salary is 80,250 USD a year&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The actual salaries range from 21,616 to 157,257 USD as of January 2017&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the &lt;em&gt;grade&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;level&lt;/em&gt; as well as other options&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In 2016, there were nearly 20,000 border patrol agents in the US&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That means that you could decide to increase the number of Border Patrol Agents by 10,000 (50%) for about 803 million USD or increase the number of Agents by 5,000 while increasing their salaries by 10% for about 602 million USD. Why do I bring up the number of Agents? Because that would mean that you are building a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;wall&lt;/em&gt; of eyes&lt;/strong&gt; in the Mexico-US border. I believe that under this scenario, you and your public relations team could convince your supporters that you delivered on your campaign promise of building a wall. It would just be a different kind of wall. The extra Border Patrol Agents and/or happier Agents (due to their increased salary) along with fewer attempts to cross the border (because immigrants would be interested in paying the &lt;em&gt;immigration tariff&lt;/em&gt;) would make them more efficient in their jobs. Some of them could be dedicated to making sure no one overstays their temporary work visa. Also note that by law, you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be a US citizen to become a Border Patrol Agent&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so you would be increasing US jobs by 5 to 10 thousand under this scenario. That is more than the 700 jobs you claim to have saved from moving to Mexico from the US by cancelling the plans to build a factory in Mexico&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I also imagine that this scenario would boost bus and airplane ticket sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of the opinion that &lt;em&gt;immigration tariffs&lt;/em&gt; would allow many individuals to have hope that they can improve their economic situation for them and their families. It would also translate &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; into a specific monetary goal. As of yesterday, 3,000 USD is about 64,000 MXN&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that translates to 800 days of minimum wage salary in Mexico&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Saving that amount of money would take over 2 years if the person didn&#39;t spend any of their income! While ideally the &lt;em&gt;immigration tariff&lt;/em&gt; would be lower than 3,000 USD, ultimately there would be a threshold that opens doors to more economic opportunity. So, Peña Nieto and Mexico have the challenge of showing that Mexicans can stay in Mexico and improve their economical situation if they can save that amount of money to start a small business, advance their education, among other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migration involves two sides and as presidents of two countries of &lt;em&gt;united states&lt;/em&gt; (American and Mexican, respectively) I encourage you to keep thinking how to &lt;em&gt;unitedly&lt;/em&gt; address migration and take over the multi million dollar market that &lt;em&gt;coyotes&lt;/em&gt; currently control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best,
Leonardo&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had to explore a table with data? I believe the answer is &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt; for most people that work at a computer or even just use it for communicating with their friends and family. Tables of data pop up everywhere, for example in personal finance. Websites like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mint.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mint.com&lt;/a&gt; allow you to download your transactions in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSV&lt;/a&gt; file called &lt;code&gt;transactions.csv&lt;/code&gt;. CSV is one of the many formats for storing tables and most likely when you try to open the &lt;code&gt;transactions.csv&lt;/code&gt; file, it will open with Excel. Now, can you make a quick figure of one of your columns in your table?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will answer yes, others no. The basic issue is that it&#39;s not &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; easy to explore your data in Excel or similar programs. Wait, shouldn&#39;t it be easy? 😕&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you want to subset your data and want to re-make the plot? How about getting some simple statistics like the mean or frequency of some categories for a given variable? 😨 These are some of the immediate tasks that are helpful when exploring data. Visually, making figures with two variables is also very common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers and experts in Excel, Stata, &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; among other options can perform these data explorations. It might take them a little bit of time to write the code or remember it or use the user interface menu of their program of choice. But what about everyone else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libd.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lieber Institute for Brain Development&lt;/a&gt; where I work, it&#39;s common for us to exchange data in tables, and thus explore data. That&#39;s why we created &lt;code&gt;shinycsv&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-shinycsv&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://github.com/LieberInstitute/shinycsv&#39;&gt;Collado-Torres, Semick, and Jaffe, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). It&#39;s an R package &lt;a id=&#39;cite-cran&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.R-project.org/&#39;&gt;R Core Team, 2016&lt;/a&gt;) that contains a &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-shiny&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny&#39;&gt;Chang, Cheng, Allaire, Xie, et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;) application that allows users to interactively explore a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is a pretty high bar, that&#39;s why we are hosting this application at &lt;a href=&#34;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/shinycsv/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/shinycsv/&lt;/a&gt;. Try it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/shinycsv/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt = &#39;shinycsv landing&#39; width=&#39;600&#39; src=&#39;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2017-01-20-shinycsv/landing.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shinycsv-application&#34;&gt;shinycsv application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application includes data about cars to demonstrate what it can do. It&#39;s a small data set that is commonly used for demonstration purposes. Anyhow, in the application you&#39;ll notice a few tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application shows the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;raw data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in an interactive table that allows you to subset the observations by some criteria, search in the table, and sort in different ways. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;raw summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tab shows quick statistical summaries which depend on the variable type (numerical, categorical, etc). If you interacted with the table in &lt;em&gt;raw data&lt;/em&gt; then the summaries at &lt;em&gt;raw summary&lt;/em&gt; will be based on the subset you selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one variable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;two variables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tabs are for making figures based on one or two variables at a time. The code in &lt;code&gt;shinycsv&lt;/code&gt; tries to guess what&#39;s the best figure for a given type of variable and in case that you are interested in learning R, it also shows the exact code you can use to reproduce the figure in your computer. We added this feature to excite users about learning R. And it&#39;s useful for advanced users too that might want to customize the resulting figures. Hm..., you don&#39;t like the colors we chose for the figure? Well go to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;plot colors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, choose another color, and come back to see your new figure with the color of your choosing. 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hm... but what if you don&#39;t have a CSV file? Well, &lt;code&gt;shinycsv&lt;/code&gt; can handle many different tables thanks to &lt;code&gt;rio&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-rio&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;#bib-rio&#39;&gt;Chan, Chan, Leeper, and Becker, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Even Excel sheets! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, go ahead and test it out! We&#39;ll be glad to hear your feedback at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LieberInstitute/shinycsv/issues&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LieberInstitute/shinycsv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that when I referred to tables earlier, I referred to square tables with different variables (age, height, weight, etc) as columns as observations as rows. That is, Excel files with a single sheet with no comments or figures inside the Excel file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you interested in learning more about &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt;? Maybe you&#39;ll want to take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/shinycsv-showcase/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;showcase mode version of the application&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use &lt;code&gt;shinycsv::explore()&lt;/code&gt; locally, the file size limit is increased to 500 MB. Although at that point you might want to consider using &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; or another programming language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about casting variables? If you want to have fine control about casting the variables, save your data in a RData file. Sure, this requires an R user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Finding possible class schedules</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend my brother wanted to figure out his class schedule for the next semester. He is a veterinary medicine and zootechnology student at UNAM. For this upcoming semester there is a set of classes he has to take and each has 8 or so instructor options. The website where he finds the class times lists about 8 pre-constructed class schedules. So he normally finds one he likes quite a bit, and then manually starts checking if he can change X instructor for Y for a given class. He does this based on the referalls and information he has gathered about the instructors, plus he factors in whether it&#39;d be an overall better schedule. For example, he might prefer to have a packed Tuesday if that means that he can leave early on Friday and avoid classes on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that it&#39;s very easy to make a mistake. You (well he) gets all excited thinking that he&#39;s found the perfect schedule. Only to then realize that there is a conflict between two classes. Or that the practical portion of a class is in a location one hour away from the university, meaning that the schedule he has selected won&#39;t work. This process is very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was watching him and I started to think if I could help him with some code. Turns out that it was straightforward to write some code to find which options are valid. Once I wrote a test case, it took us like half an hour to fill out the data. I know that tomorrow is when he and his classmates start registering for classes, so this information might help his classmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I define some helper functions. These are rather straightforward but I&#39;ll be using them later on. For example, &lt;code&gt;dias()&lt;/code&gt; is just there for typing less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;## Helper functions
dias &amp;lt;- function(d, i) {
    paste0(d, i)
}

extract &amp;lt;- function(m, p) {
    m[[p]]
}

extract_names &amp;lt;- function(m, p) {
    names(m)[p]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next comes the input information. I organized it in a set of nested &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; objects. The schedule is stored as a character vector. For example, Lucia Eliana&#39;s class meets on Wednesdays (&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;iercoles in Spanish) from 9 to 11 am. I only keep the starting hours (9 and 10 am) because otherwise the code won&#39;t detect valid opitons that include another class that starts at 11 am. For classes that are 1 hour away from the university, we included 1 hour before and 1 hour after the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;## Input class/prof info and schedule
materias &amp;lt;- list(
    repro = list(
        &#39;lucia eliana&#39; = c(dias(&#39;m&#39;, 9:10), dias(&#39;j&#39;, 9:10), dias(&#39;v&#39;, 8:13)),

        &#39;1705&#39; = c(dias(&#39;l&#39;, 11:13), dias(&#39;m&#39;, 7:11)),
        &#39;1706&#39; = c(dias(&#39;ma&#39;, 15:17), dias(&#39;m&#39;, 15:19)),
        &#39;1707&#39; = c(dias(&#39;ma&#39;, 10:12), dias(&#39;j&#39;, 10:15)),
        &#39;1708&#39; = c(dias(&#39;l&#39;, 18:20), dias(&#39;ma&#39;, 15:19)),
        &#39;1709&#39; = c(dias(&#39;l&#39;, 11:13), dias(&#39;j&#39;, 8:13)),
        &#39;1711&#39; = c(dias(&#39;j&#39;, 13:15), dias(&#39;v&#39;, 10:13))
    )
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the input information is complete, I use &lt;code&gt;expand.grid()&lt;/code&gt; to find out all the different possible options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;## Get all the options
options &amp;lt;- expand.grid(lapply(materias, function(x) { seq_len(length(x))}))
dim(options)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 81000     5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s 81,00 of them including the classes that meet on Saturday. You can see why it&#39;s a frustrating process to find which combination of classes work when doing this manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I explore all these options to find those that are valid, meaning that none of the classes overlap. I do this by finding which options have no duplicated hours from the character vectors defined earlier. Nothing fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;valid &amp;lt;- apply(options, 1, function(input) {
    info &amp;lt;- mapply(extract, materias, input)
    !any(duplicated(unlist(info)))
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the valid options, I can find the names of the instructors for them. There&#39;s 2,847 valid schedules in the end, out of the 81,000. That&#39;s 3.5 percent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;valid_prof &amp;lt;- apply(options[valid, ], 1, function(input) {
    mapply(extract_names, materias, input)
})
ncol(valid_prof)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 2847
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can search the interactive version &lt;a href=&#34;https://lcolladotor.shinyapps.io/materias/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to select only the options with a given instructor. For example, in my brother&#39;s case there are 30 valid options once he decided to prioritize two instructors as shown in the non-interactive table below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;## Ideally, this code would create an interactive table, but it doesn&#39;t work for some reason:
#library(&#39;DT&#39;)
#datatable(t(valid_prof), options = list(pagingType=&#39;full_numbers&#39;, pageLength=10), rownames = FALSE)
valid_prof &amp;lt;- t(valid_prof)
rownames(valid_prof) &amp;lt;- seq_len(nrow(valid_prof))
top_options &amp;lt;- valid_prof[valid_prof[, 1] == &#39;lucia eliana&#39; &amp;amp; valid_prof[, 2] %in% c(&#39;isaac reyes&#39;, &#39;isaac reyes 2&#39;), ]
kable(top_options, format = &#39;markdown&#39;, row.names = TRUE)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;repro&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;bacterianas&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;parasitarias&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;diagnosticas&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.imagechef.com/ic/ribbon/&#39;&gt;&lt;img alt = &#39;Federico Sanchez Ribbon&#39; height=&#39;300&#39; src=&#39;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2016-04-04-FedericoSanchez/Fede-Ribbon.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UNAM&lt;/a&gt; community at large mourns the passing of Federico Sánchez Rodríguez. He got his bachelor&#39;s degree from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.quimica.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;School of Chemistry - UNAM&lt;/a&gt;, masters and PhD degrees from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biomedicas.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Biomedicas - UNAM&lt;/a&gt;, postdoc from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ucsf.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;, was a member of CIFN-UNAM now called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ccg.unam.mx/en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; (it&#39;s his affiliation in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jbc.org/content/258/20/12618.full.pdf+html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; 1983 paper), and worked most of his career at &lt;a href=&#34;http://ibt.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IBT-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.ibt.unam.mx/server/PRG.base?tipo:doc,dir:PRG.curriculum,par:federico&#39;&gt;&lt;img alt = &#39;Federico Sanchez homepage&#39; height=&#39;227&#39; src=&#39;http://www.ibt.unam.mx/img/fot/federico.gif&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure that he made many friends, trained many students at all levels, and had a highly productive academic career as evidenced on his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ibt.unam.mx/server/PRG.base?tipo:doc,dir:PRG.curriculum,par:federico&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt; where he lists many papers, patents, etc. A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S%C3%A1nchez%20F%5BAuthor%5D&amp;amp;cauthor=true&amp;amp;cauthor_uid=26911872&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PubMed author search&lt;/a&gt; includes his papers but be careful to not confuse him with other authors that shared his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll remember Federico fondly for the time we shared at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/es/about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;. He was a great teacher and motivated me to ask as many questions as I could think of. My background in biology was weaker than my classmates, and I loved to ask questions of the sort: if X biolgical process is possible, could Y happen in the cell? He let my imagination run wild. Federico was very supportive of an elective class a few of us organized in our 4th year. You could always tell that he fed off the energy of enthusiastic students. He was always there if you needed some advice. At the end of my time at LCG-UNAM, he enjoyed how I argued against other members of the LCG academic committee. He always supported me in my non-traditional choices. Federico knew many things about plants, but also about the best food, the best drinks, and was always eager to share his knowledge with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of my last interactions with him at &lt;em&gt;FedeFest&lt;/em&gt; in August 2014, I asked him a question in the style that I used to during class. I asked him how would he evaluate results from single-cell sequencing and verify that the results were indeed biogical and not technical. A month later, I sent him &lt;a href=&#34;http://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0452-9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fede, I will always remember you fondly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best,
Leonardo&lt;/p&gt;

I just flew in last night from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/enar2016&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;#ENAR2016&lt;/a&gt; and I&#39;m getting ready for a postdoc interview tomorrow, which means that I&#39;m also flying today. On the flight back from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/enar2016&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;#ENAR2016&lt;/a&gt; I started reading a book my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/StrictlyStat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;John Muschelli&lt;/a&gt; bought for me. It&#39;s called &lt;strong&gt;The Happiness Advantage&lt;/strong&gt; by Shawn Anchor and so far I&#39;m loving it. There are several things that it talks about that I&#39;ve done in the past, but maybe not in the past year. Anyhow, I&#39;ll probably talk about it in a separate blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Advantage-Principles-Performance-Paperback/dp/B00BR9RW4U/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457631904&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+happiness+advantage&#39;&gt;&lt;img alt = &#39;Happiness Advantage&#39; height=&#39;346&#39; src=&#39;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41g4uexkAfL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But coincidentally, a friend of mine from undergrad just shared with me the following YouTube video. Watching it made me very happy! We definitely had a blast during undergrad. The person that talks about Boston is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Bieber&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Frederick Bieber&lt;/a&gt; (he&#39;s kinda hard to google due to his last name) who at the time worked with 5 of my classmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My undergrad class from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/es/about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; (link is in English) was the 3rd one (yup, still guinea pigs) and the only one to start off with 40 students. Some left to study other degrees, most of us continue to work in academia getting our master&#39;s, PhDs, postdocs done; others have chosen different career paths, and sadly one of us already passed away. But I bet we can all say that 2005-2009 were good and &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt; years.&lt;/p&gt;
