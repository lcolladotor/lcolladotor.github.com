## Functions {.smaller} # .smaller works in .Rmd but not in .Rpres format.
 
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
square <- function(x) x^2
square(2)
 
pow <- function(x, p=2) x^p
pow(10)
pow(10,3)
pow(p=3,10)
 
```

## What is R?
 
- A Domain-Specific-Language (DSL) for statistics and data analysis
- Based on the S Programming Language
- An environment for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- A quasi-functional language with IDE and REPL
- A vectorized language with BLAS support
- A collection of over 7,000+ libraries
- A large and active community across industry and academia
- Around 20 years old (Lineage dates from 1975 - almost 40 years ago)
 
```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
options("digits"=5)
options("digits.secs"=3)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
