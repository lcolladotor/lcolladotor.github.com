      <title>End of the summer blogger challenge</title>

      <description>This summer a few of us at Bmore Biostats agreed to a summer iron blogger challenge. We either had to blog every week or every two weeks. The penalty of not publishing a post in our chosen timeframe was to donate 5 or 10 USD (respectively) to our charity of choice.
I liked the idea of the blogging challenge and thought it would help me keep motivated to keep my blog active during the summer.</description>

      <description>I do not have a clear memory of when I started to write or in which language it was. My first written words might have been in English since I lived in Boston (USA) three years during my early childhood. By age five I was back in Mexico and that is where I am sure I wrote my first full homeworks. During elementary school, I changed languages once moreâ€”this time to French.</description>

      <title>And so begins English Composition I</title>

      <description>This week started the English Composition I: Achieving Expertise course (Comer, 2013) that I have been looking forward to.
I am not sure yet how long I will last, but I hope to enjoy it as much as I can. Plus, it should help me with my posting and other writing areas. While I last in the course, I plan to publish my writings in the blog too. So you will hopefully see me be more active here.</description>
