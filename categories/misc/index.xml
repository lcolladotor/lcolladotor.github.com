      <description>


&lt;p&gt;In the past months I’ve had a recurrent conversation with many people. This conversation is typically started with the question: why do you like living where you live? Some of them might be considering moving to the city I live in for work, some of them are thinking about leaving, some are happy here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, everyone is different and what makes some happy might not be for the rest. Some friends want to live in larger cities, others want different climates, others want to move in with their long distance relationship partners, etc. Back in 2015 I was finishing my Ph.D. and thinking about moving somewhere else in 2016. So I started to disengage from friends and the city itself. In the past couple of years, I’ve tried to change my attitude. Or well, adopt my parents’ attitude and follow their lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frequently compared my current city versus my home city. This comparison used to be skewed in favor of my home city: my current city didn’t have the tacos I loved, or the quesadillas at the market, or my family, childhood friends, etc. At some point I started to point out in my head what my current city has that my home city doesn’t have or isn’t as accessible. One of them is a large open, free and largely secure park where you can ride a bike or play tennis like Patterson Park. So I pushed myself to go biking and play tennis in 2018. I also found a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2019/02/03/the-power-of-tapping-into-your-community-for-support/#.XGOPnlxKiUk&#34;&gt;Mexican restaurant that feels like home&lt;/a&gt;. I made new friends that understood aspects of me that I didn’t show as much to others here, mostly due to cultural differences. And I started going more frequently to listen to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bsomusic.org/&#34;&gt;Baltimore Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; (BSO). So my advice for those who find their current city lacking versus their ideal city or hometown is to start looking for the activities that might be inaccessible elsewhere and that you enjoy. I really like the BSO, so I’ll get into more details about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;first-symphony&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First symphony&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy the BSO events and the story starts back in six grade in Madison, Wisconsin. That was my only year there and the school assigned me&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the chorus. That was new to me and I liked it quite a bit. At some point the chorus teacher offered some free tickets for a couple of students and their families to attend an event at a Madison symphony with a soprano solo. I don’t remember the name of the symphony nor the solo, but I was like, “sure, why not? Can I get the tickets?”. I knew that my family liked classical music and the teacher was happy that a student showed interest in the tickets. I had taken classical guitar lessons when I was younger because my dad loved it and we had several classical music CDs at home. I was blown away by the soprano solo despite my mom forcing me to dress up hehe. The second and last time the chorus teacher offered tickets, I was eager to get them, and we greatly enjoyed the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;classical-music-here-and-there&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Classical music here and there&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the years in Mexico, we would sometimes go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://musica.unam.mx/taquillas/sala-nezahualcoyotl/&#34;&gt;UNAM’s Sala Nezahualcóyotl&lt;/a&gt;. But it was always a bit of a trek: about 1.5 hr drive, early on the weekend, etc. It was maybe a bit too much and we would frequently get sleepy. I mostly listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planets&#34;&gt;The Planets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1812_Overture&#34;&gt;Overture 1812&lt;/a&gt; at home and particularly in family road trips. I remember one time crossing Aguascalientes where we had the volume super high during a portion where the symphony plays very low, and then boom, the symphony gets loud and my mom and brother were on the back of the car and complained quite a bit, but my dad and myself were really into it. So listening to the symphony reminds me about good times with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bso-during-grad-school&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BSO during grad school&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSO offers &lt;em&gt;student rush tickets&lt;/em&gt; for 10 USD the day of the event as well as a &lt;em&gt;BSO student passport&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is worth it if you go to 4 or more events in a season. Check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bsomusic.org/calendar/special-offers/&#34;&gt;discount programs&lt;/a&gt; for more information. Through a combination of both I went several times to the BSO in my 5 years of graduate studies. But most importantly, I went to the season finales which tend to be on the first week of June. The season finale in 2012 was just after my masters comprehensive exam, and the one in 2013 was also just after my Ph.D. comprehensive exam. Both exams were brutal to study for and the BSO season finales were an incredible release of tension and energy for me. I felt many emotions during both finales and loved them dearly (they also featured choruses!). Over the years I went to many events and there was even a season when several of my grad school friends and I got the BSO student passports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bso-since&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BSO since&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating, I got a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bsomusic.org/calendar/special-offers/&#34;&gt;BSO passport&lt;/a&gt; which is a great opportunity for those under 40 years old (nowadays it’s 99 USD) to attend as many events as you want in the season. I started to use the symphony as a way to work through my anxiety issues and mostly didn’t bother to invite friends. While that worked for me, in the 2018-2019 season I’ve been more proactive at inviting friends. I love it when a friend who hasn’t experienced the symphony much enjoys the show&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or simply a reason to get out of their house and enjoy Baltimore a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bso-opportunities-and-challenges&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BSO opportunities and challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, I’ve also been donating to the BSO. I’m never a high donor or anything like that, but I like to contribute a little bit. I’m thankful for the wealthy donors that keep the BSO discount programs running and that I’ve personally benefited so much from. If you think about it, not long ago listening to a symphony was something only those in court did. Today it’s true that you can notice many wealthy patrons. But there are also opportunities for those with limited resources to attend and enjoy this world-class symphony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also challenges. I’ve seen patrons complain about noises kids make: it’s hard to ask kids to stay quiet all the time. There are circumstances that magnify this: you can tell some kids have grown up surrounded by classical music while others haven’t. I think that a bit of tolerance can go a long way here to make sure newcomers feel welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenge that I think is very tricky is social media and phones. Many of my friends, myself included, like posting on social media. Taking videos and photos during most BSO events is strictly prohibited. I understand this from two reasons: first, the bright light of phones is disruptive&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and secondly, the symphony wants to try to motivate people to attend the shows in person. I either take photos before the show or at the very end&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s definitely a culture clash between what happens outside the symphony and what happens inside. We’ll see what time tells, but I do like that the BSO is trying to use Instagram more now. After all, social media in theory can help attract interest from others to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the BSO faces strong financial challenges which you can read about in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bsomusic.org/misc/bso-updates/&#34;&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; section. They are doing many things, including a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bsomusic.org/giving/bso-day-of-giving-2019/&#34;&gt;donation drive that ended yesterday&lt;/a&gt; for their anniversary. But as long as they continue their discount programs, this is a great opportunity that I encourage my friends to grab a hold on. It might even change your answer to the question: “do you like living in Baltimore?”, or well, play a role in it. It does play a role for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s me with some friends at a BSO event in December 2018. We didn’t know then, but the BSO president took our picture for us 😅
Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;This week the owner of my favorite Mexican restaurant in Baltimore, Rosalyn Vera, got death and arson&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; threats. I could have been a bystander, but I tapped into my network and asked for help and she has received it. It’s been great to see the power of the community in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-backstory&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The backstory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34;&gt;Bioconductor&lt;/a&gt; for work and I get to witness the warmth and mostly friendly &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; community where daily people ask for help and get it. Born from the R community is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org/&#34;&gt;RLadies&lt;/a&gt; organization that provides a platform for non-cis gendered males to share their knowledge and increase their visibility. In one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies-baltimore.github.io/&#34;&gt;RLadies Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; events, I met a Data Journalist from the Baltimore Sun, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/christinezhang&#34;&gt;Christine Zhang&lt;/a&gt; who gave an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_baltimore/blob/master/20181114_industry.md&#34;&gt;excellent talk&lt;/a&gt; on how she uses R for her job: for example, election maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, I’m Mexican. To get over &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/11/mindfulness/#.XFdVC1xKiUk&#34;&gt;my homesickness&lt;/a&gt; these past months I’ve been a frequent customer at a small Mexican restaurant in Baltimore called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cocinaluchadoras/&#34;&gt;Cocina Luchadoras&lt;/a&gt;. I also frequent live shows from a band called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/somebadhombres/&#34;&gt;Bad Hombres&lt;/a&gt; that plays covers of Spanish rock songs from the 80s and 90s, go to Latin karaoke nights organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/rootsraicesfest/&#34;&gt;Root Raíces&lt;/a&gt;, among other things that bring me joy&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;initial-threats-and-reactions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initial threats and reactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To warm up this week, I went to get some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=atole+de+arroz&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;atole de arroz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at Cocina Luchadoras twice. The second time was just about an hour after Rosalyn received death and arson threats on Thursday. I could tell that she was scared but she was also incredibly brave. The threats were because she has placed a sign on her restaurant to support the &lt;em&gt;Donald&lt;/em&gt; fundraising campaign from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ilegalmezcal.com/donald/&#34;&gt;Ilegal Mezcal&lt;/a&gt; that says “Donald, eres un pendejo” (Donald, you are stupid) . The person making the threats mentioned that immigrants are taking away jobs from US citizens. As a Hispanic customer, I got scared as well and became suspicious of whoever entered the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does one do? How would you react to a hate crime threat? Or well, any threat? Call the police. Do you comply with the request to take down the poster? Hire security? Close and move to a different location? I feel like situations like this put can you at odds between following your ideals and being pragmatic. In this case, Rosalyn had to decide whether to stand by her free speech rights or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States of America you expect that the police and the institutions that protect the law will help you. Unlike Guatemala in the 1960s when the police/military tried to silence/kill my grandfather due to the health clinic he and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/07/30/harassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiration-from-my-grandmother/#.XFdafFxKiUk&#34;&gt;my grandmother&lt;/a&gt; had where they would treat people from many backgrounds: he closed down, moved to Mexico, and had to be pragmatic and abandon some of his ideals. Or unlike Mexico in recent times, where there’s widespread insecurity due to the war on drugs, corruption, etc. For example, my father’s house was broken into, he got tied down and was punched until a few ribs broke: he called a Mexican military veteran for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here in the US, you call the police and wait for them to do their job. But you can also decide to ask for help from your community. So I offered Rosalyn my time and network, and she accepted. This was tricky as I told her, because I didn’t want to either give a platform for the person making the threats or to attract other people like him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Christine for help on whom to talk to at the Baltimore Sun, and she responded immediately. After some emails and knocking on a couple more doors, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-cocina-luchadoras-20190201-story.html&#34;&gt;Baltimore Sun published an article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LillianEReed&#34;&gt;Lillian E Reed&lt;/a&gt; with contributions by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_ThaliaJuarez&#34;&gt;Thalia Juarez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cdrentz&#34;&gt;Catherine Rentz&lt;/a&gt;. Catherine has published some great work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-two-years-of-hate-incidents-20180813-story.html&#34;&gt;hate crimes in Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and they’ve made an &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.baltimoresun.com/maryland-hate-crimes/&#34;&gt;interactive map&lt;/a&gt; to browse the data. From there, the word kept spreading and many started to show their support: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/ame4se/man_allegedly_threatened_to_kill_baltimore/&#34;&gt;Baltimore Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, local &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zeke_cohen/status/1091798436628832256&#34;&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt;, and many regular Cocina Luchadores customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-threats-continue&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The threats continue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went again on Saturday and the place was packed and things seemed to be trending on the right direction. The police had called and were supposed to meet with Rosalyn later. Instead, they didn’t show up and the person making the threats called again…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an allocation of limited resources, I understand that the Baltimore Police has many things to do and many people to keep safe. Catherine Rentz’ &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-two-years-of-hate-incidents-20180813-story.html&#34;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on hate crimes in Maryland from 2016 and 2017 highlights that this type of crime is likely underreported and that there are very few convictions. Maybe this went through the mind of the policeman who did the report on Thursday: “threat phone call? No witnesses? Ok, not enough evidence… move on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a very hard time processing the no-show by the police though. Talking to others, we discussed how the law enforcement system is overworked (they are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wmar2news.com/homepage-showcase/baltimore-police-to-switch-to-new-patrol-schedule&#34;&gt;reducing the police officer shift length&lt;/a&gt; soon) and swamped. But hey, there’s a supportive community. So I asked for help again. “Who knows someone at the Baltimore Police?” That was the question and soon enough one friend replied, and then emailed a lieutenant. By the next morning (Sunday/today), the Baltimore Police chief was looking to call Rosalyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we let the Baltimore Sun know that the person had made the threat again. They quickly posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-threat-over-anti-trump-poster-spurs-business-20190202-story.html&#34;&gt;new story&lt;/a&gt; where they report how Rosalyn first made sure to secure more witnesses this time and secondly told the person making the threats that she has only love for him and thanked him for the phone call. I think that she was really smart with both and she does mean it. In a chat with friends, one of them suggested bringing tacos as a peace offering to the person making the threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second story by the Baltimore Sun got shared by Newsweek in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newsweek.com/restaurant-owner-allegedly-receives-death-threats-over-anti-trump-banner-1315971&#34;&gt;own story&lt;/a&gt;. A friend who is in Mexico right now told me he saw it on the top Apple News stories. Today, there was a security guard at Cocina Luchadoras, who smiled and opened the door for anyone coming in. So spreading the word, asking for help, knocking on doors, and the power of the community is very strong. Strong enough to get the police to pay more attention to Rosalyn’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is incredible! Typically, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RLadies&#34;&gt;#RLadies&lt;/a&gt; request for help ends up with a friendly reply pointing to an existing R package or a suggestion on what to do. This time, we gamed the system. So yes, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/11/12/asking-for-help-is-challenging-but-is-typically-worth-it/#.XFdT41xKiUk&#34;&gt;asking for help is challenging but can be worth it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And surely everyone who’s involved in helping in this story can use it to request the help they need. For example, the Baltimore Sun’s hate crime reporting team can ask for more space and resources for their stories. Or the Baltimore and Maryland Police can ask for help from whoever controls their budget&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so they can get more resources to fight the increase in hate crimes, improve the reporting of hate crime threats, and reach out ot the Hispanic community in Baltimore. If they need a letter of support, they can get one from me if they want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, it’s a chance to try to live without fear. Fear is a powerful feeling and I’ve seen it in action. I experienced it first hand when everyone I knew stopped going out in Cuernavaca during an intense period of the war on drugs when military were deployed to the streets. It’s also a chance for us Hispanics in Baltimore to feel like we belong here, which is the same challenge many women and non-cis males have and hence the reason why &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org/&#34;&gt;RLadies&lt;/a&gt; is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;and-drop-by-to-enjoy-the-awesome-food-and-women-art&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;And drop by to enjoy the awesome food and women art!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you drop by in Baltimore, you should go visit Cocina Luchadoras! Their food is deliciously awesome. It starts with handmade tortillas. You use tortillas for many things including tacos. A good tortilla can boost the flavor in a taco, and the ones at Cocina Luchadoras are outstanding! Then there’s the filling which can range from pork (&lt;em&gt;al pastor&lt;/em&gt;) to different types of vegetables. And while you wait, you get to experience a women’s empowerment museum with all the arts and crafts they have there about how women are really strong! You also get to meet many interesting patrons and make new friends if you wish to do so. Even if you are not in Baltimore, you should follow them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cocinaluchadoras/&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/cocinaluchadoras/&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for great art and food pictures (or &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobile.twitter.com/cocinaluchadora&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but they don’t post images there, just links to Instagram).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been thinking on the subject of asking for help. In short, it’s hard to ask for help. It involves admitting to yourself that you can’t solve the problem alone, opening yourself up, hoping that another person will understand you and guide you in the right direction. Thus it can be painful if your request for help is misunderstood, met with criticism or ignored. Regardless of these obstacles, I think that the potential rewards make it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly encounter the situation of asking for help in two scenarios. One is about work, mostly R programming. The other one is about personal issues. There are plenty more, like spelling, cultural references, word definitions and academic citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Thank you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m always learning more English! Last night it was “yule” via &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BenLangmead?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@BenLangmead&lt;/a&gt; and others&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeepLearning?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#DeepLearning&lt;/a&gt;? 🙃 &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/kX9JTnSBAn&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/kX9JTnSBAn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Dr. Leonardo Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1061281934666543106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;November 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;PCR was invented by Kary Mullis in 1984. He won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for it in 1993. real-time PCR (qPCR) was developed about ten years later and originates with this paper: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/gpIOr3s7PG&#34;&gt;https://t.co/gpIOr3s7PG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Lior Pachter (@lpachter) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lpachter/status/1061288301825413121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;November 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;programming-context&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Programming context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of R and Bioconductor, and programming in general, it can be scary to ask for help in public forums such as a GitHub issue page, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34;&gt;Bioconductor Support website&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;RStudio Community website&lt;/a&gt;, etc. That’s because you might get a very short reply that can seem unhelpful if it involves terms you are not familiar with (though it might be a precise reply). There are also issues with online communities that I won’t get into. Over the years, I’ve tried to help those who will potentially answer my questions by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double checking the documentation&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing information to reproduce my problem: sometimes doing so makes me realize my mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying for a while (&amp;gt;20 min?) to solve the problem by myself which involves googling quite a bit. However, sometimes I’m not aware of the correct search terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding sounding like I’m demanding help, asking for help immediately or requesting the same person for help lots of times in a short time window&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also tried to highlight my main question, though this can be hard when you are not sure what’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get a short reply that seems unfriendly, I try to be appreciative of the time this other person took to reply to me. The terms they use in their reply can be important clues on what to search on Google next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language matters and I hate it when others make me feel dumb instead of guiding me to the right documentation/website, while others might dislike receiving tons of loose ended questions. Ultimately, this process requires patience on both sides and I highly value efforts by others that try to make it easier for both the person asking for help and the person responding. See for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some my recent requests for help with replies by others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still make mistakes by not been clear enough sometimes, that’s why I typically say: “please let me know if you need more information” or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;personal-context&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking for help in a programming context is hard because you are leaving your questions public (most of the time): that way you can reach multiple people that can potentially answer your question, and the people answering the question want them to be public with the hope that the answers will help others. Asking for help in personal context is different, since it tends to be in private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might just be me, but I’ve had several situations in my life where I’ve opened up and asked a group of individuals for help. For example, I recently started a conversation with several friends about ways to limit alcohol consumption. It was scary at first to bring this topic up, but the friends I talked to about this subject had also been thinking about it and it lead to some great conversations. I have other examples listed in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/misc/timeline.pdf&#34;&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on occasions where others have helped me with career advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One story that I want to share now is about grad school. I was a first year student and I had an accident one Friday in February. I knew immediately that I needed a surgery to repair my shoulder. I already had experience with orthopedic surgeons in Mexico whose quality was widely variable: it took my family years to find one we could trust for my first surgery. In my first year at a new city and country, I didn’t have my family’s network support. So I reached out via email to the faculty that I had met in person with the hopes that one of them knew a good orthopedic surgeon. This was a personal help request, so I didn’t use the Department wide mailing list. The response was excellent, and not only did some faculty help me find an excellent orthopedic surgeon, but also get an appointment with him for Monday. After my appointment on Monday, I replied to the same set of faculty thanking them for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that week, one faculty dropped by my office to reprimand me for emailing all the faculty. I assume that this faculty thought I had emailed the whole Department. This situation shocked me and made me feel awful. My mind started racing and I wanted to clarify the situation with the faculty member. It was taking a lot of my internal courage to approach this faculty member and a second faculty member noticed that I wasn’t well. This second faculty member listened to me&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and later invited me to have dinner with his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Department staff member also helped me during these weeks and pointed me to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jhsap.org/&#34;&gt;Johns Hopkins Student Assistance Program&lt;/a&gt; where I got help (2 or 3 sessions). Getting professional help was great; some things I remember were that they explained to me that I was mourning since injuring my arm was like losing a piece of me (given my injury history) and they also explained potential cultural differences that lead to the situation with the first faculty member. Once I calmed down, I did email the first faculty to clarify what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a rough situation and probably my toughest moment in grad school, or at least among the top ones. I also value it as a learning moment and it fueled me and continues to do so in some ways. For example, it motivated me to organize Cultural Mixer events (see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/11/20/StudentMixer3/#.W-pKO-hKiUk&#34;&gt;ad for the third event&lt;/a&gt;), with the hope that they would help us understand each other better&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as creating the Biostat Social mailing list (now defunct but replaced by a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/19/using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication/#.W-pLHehKiUk&#34;&gt;Department Slack&lt;/a&gt;). I also think that the reactions to my request for help were overall positive. The balance for sure is positive although there was a bit of negative in the mix. I wish others would just get positive reactions with zero negative ones, but there are no guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this post I’m hoping to invite others to reflect on situations that involve asking for help. I also hope that others break their internal barriers and ask for help when needed. Echoing words of others, asking for help takes courage. Given the potential rewards, I encourage you to ask for help from your family, friends and colleagues depending on the situation. Simply knowing the term(s) for what you are searching for in code or for what you are feeling (for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hopstat.wordpress.com/2015/10/14/dealing-with-imposter-syndrome-in-graduate-school/&#34;&gt;imposter syndrome&lt;/a&gt;) can help a lot. Also being directed to professionals, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://jhsap.org/&#34;&gt;JHSAP&lt;/a&gt; in my shoulder story, and the proper documentation manual, like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html&#34;&gt;R admin devel manual&lt;/a&gt;, can propel you in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of luck walking the uphill path of asking for help!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many times I’ve started to write this post in my mind since May 2018. Today I’m finally typing it on the computer. This will be a rather long post that ties in several threads. I’ll talk about Cold Spring Harbor’s Biology of Genomes conference and its relationship to my undergrad in Mexico. I’ll also introduce you to Aldo Barrientos (1987-2011) who was was my undergrad classmate. Then I’ll tell you about myself and how regardless of your situation, privileged or not, you should ask for help and get to know the people around you. Finally, I want to highlight that many other Mexican researchers are doing great work and would love to be invited to talk about their work. Or simply, the opportunity to compete for scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;cshl-and-lcg-unam&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CSHL and LCG-UNAM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past May I was selected to give a talk at &lt;a href=&#34;http://meetings.cshl.edu/Genome18&#34;&gt;Biology of Genomes 2018&lt;/a&gt; (BOG) at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cshl.edu/&#34;&gt;Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (CSHL). This was my first time being there and I had plenty of time to reflect before my talk&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For me, attending BOG was like a dream come true so I was blown away when I was selected to present at BOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard about the BOG conference when I was studying my undergrad in Mexico at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/es/about&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;. My class has a history with the conference too. Basically, part of the class was meeting to discuss what optional courses to create for our fourth year, and well, some miscommunication happened among us. This created a rift in the group and was one of my motivations for focusing on communication as well as giving back. The former lead to me being elected as class president and the latter lead to me volunteering to teach R courses later on my undergrad&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As BOG18 went underway, some of my fellow junior presenters started their talks by mentioning why CSHL was special to them. Following their cue, I wrote some notes just before my presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/2018-11-06%2021.21.51.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to give a shoutout to all my LCG-UNAM classmates. I also thought of Aldo Barrientos and how it could have been him at BOG. This got me nervous, but I really wanted to do it. I also wanted this to be short and professional. You can see how it turned out for yourself&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRGkibDQgIc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;aldo-barrientos&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aldo Barrientos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time for me to tell you more about Aldo Barrientos, my LCG-UNAM classmate. I won’t attempt to tell you his whole story since I think that others could write a much more detailed one that myself. I hope they do and if they are made public, I’ll share them from this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldo came from a low income family in Mexico: I believe that his father was a construction worker&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He was smart and advanced through school successfully. He took the entry exam for LCG-UNAM like many people did in 2005. Eventually only around 10-15 percent of the applicants were admitted to this undergrad program. The school was free (25 Mexican cents per year), but it involved relocating to a new city. UNAM has some scholarship programs, but they are not enough. Aldo found a way like he always did. For example, he sold candy and juice to his classmates during lunch break. For reasons that I don’t remember, Aldo didn’t complete his undergrad in 2009 but was about to in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember Aldo as a very joyful person who was always smiling and joking with the rest of us. He had the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; dancing skills of anyone at my undergrad. He proved them time and time again, for example winning a dance contest at a party in my house and wearing the Pumas UNAM puma costume in our graduation party and dancing with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/goyo.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sk.pinterest.com/pin/170714642102216698/&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His path was cut abruptly in 2011. He was stabbed multiple times while waiting for someone. We all knew about this. It’s still unclear to me how everything happened in the following months. But I remember being told that he tried seeing a doctor before going back to his home. One day in 2011, we all started to learn about how grave his situation had turned. I didn’t know what to do&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I talked to David Romero, director (dean?) of CCG-UNAM back then. He guided me and others and we were trying to coordinate ways to help Aldo, but by the time we got to his home it was too late. I regret that we weren’t able to help Aldo earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have some emails from 2011 when we were talking about doing something to honour him. We never did as a class, though LCG-UNAM did acknowledge him. Maybe one day we will do an event to remember him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldo faced more challenges that myself and other classmates. Yet I believe that he would have kept solving them one by one; he would have gotten his undergrad degree and had he chosen to stay in academia, then present his research findings at conferences like BOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;privileged-yes-entitled-no&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Privileged yes, entitled no&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about Aldo made reflect also on who has been around in my own path, who has helped me and how grateful I am to them. Undoubtedly I’ve had an easier path than others including Aldo. That is, I’ve been privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even with my privileged position it has been a hard fought battle to get to where I am now. I think that a mistake others do is that they assume that they are entitled to something given their privilege instead of working for that thing. This can apply to visas and the like where you still &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/19/problems-with-an-article-from-the-baltimore-sun-covering-dr-mahoney-steel-s-immigration-issues/&#34;&gt;have to apply for them in time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along my way I have hesitated many times what to do and have sought guidance from others. Also along my way, I’ve tried to get to know others in my surroundings. Now that I look back I realize that many people were at my position or in junior positions have kept working towards their career goals and advanced in them. So, if you can, get to know others and learn from them. They could be the future Full Professors with Tenure, future Senior Software Engineers or other titles you look up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an incomplete version of my timeline (&lt;a href=&#34;/misc/timeline.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF version&lt;/a&gt;). I think that it’s pretty hard to list everyone who has helped you along the way. For example, I’m not mentioning my Ph.D. classmates from whom I learned many things. But it will give you a more detailed picture of the amount of people that have helped me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/timeline.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;invite-lcg-unam-alumni&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Invite LCG-UNAM alumni&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said at the beginning of my BOG18 talk, I’m not sure if I’m the first LCG-UNAM alumni to present at BOG but I know for sure that I won’t be the last one. That’s because I’m really proud of my classmates and all the great work they are doing. It’s also easy to go beyond my class to other LCG-UNAM alumni and then even go beyond and extend this to Mexican researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken from my timeline, here are a few that I mentioned there (links are to their Twitter profiles):&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Today, September 19th 2018, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com/balnews-dan-rodricks-20130507-staff.html&#34;&gt;Dan Rodricks&lt;/a&gt; (Twitter: &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/DanRodricks&#34;&gt;DanRodricks&lt;/a&gt;) published an article in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com&#34;&gt;Baltimore Sun&lt;/a&gt;. The article was shared to me with the title &lt;em&gt;I only thought this happened to Mexicans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is currently titled&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/dan-rodricks-blog/bs-md-rodricks-0919-story.html&#34;&gt;“Rodricks: Hopkins library specialist hit by immigration crackdown after being blindsided by visa denial”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-19-problems-with-an-article-from-the-baltimore-sun-covering-dr-mahoney-steel-s-immigration-issues_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-19%20at%2011.43.50%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like the title at all nor did I feel right when reading the article. I shared it with about 50 other Mexicans in Baltimore&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, talked about it over dinner, discussed a bit with Hopkins colleagues, and now thanks to all of them I have a clearer idea of what my problems with this article are. And there are many of them, but we can group them into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reporting by Dan Rodricks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; handling of Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s case by Johns Hopkins University,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; lack of attention by Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into all of it, there is a petition online in support of Dr. Mahoney-Steel that you can read and sign &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/johns-hopkins-university-support-dr-tamsyn-mahoney-steel-and-all-displaced-workers&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you want: nearly 2,000 people have already signed it. You can also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/johns-hopkins-university-support-dr-tamsyn-mahoney-steel-and-all-displaced-workers/c?source_location=petition_show&#34;&gt;read other’s reasons&lt;/a&gt; for signing the petition. Right now I do not feel comfortable signing this petition, but maybe you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-reporting-by-dan-rodricks&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The reporting by Dan Rodricks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article starts by framing Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s story around the fact that she had to return to England due to issues with her immigration paperwork and that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the reaction of several friends and colleagues was uncannily the same: “I thought this only happened to Mexicans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no need at all to grab attention to Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s story by mentioning Mexicans or any other Spanish-speaking immigrants. Dan Rodricks is trying to get the reader to think that &lt;em&gt;Mexicans are illegal immigrants&lt;/em&gt; (which many politicians have said), and thus that &lt;em&gt;they aren’t welcome&lt;/em&gt;, and then &lt;em&gt;ohh, others aren’t welcome either&lt;/em&gt;. Another interpretation of this quote is that &lt;em&gt;Mexicans are uneducated&lt;/em&gt;, which would be equally offending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m glad that the title has been changed at the Baltimore Sun’s website, the first paragraph and last paragraph of the story still mention this quote that is attributed to friends and colleagues of Dr. Mahoney-Steel. They might have said this, but Dan Rodricks could have simply ignored their quote and framed his story along the lines of the updated title: a library specialist that is suffering because of the current immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second problem with the reporting is that there is a lack of information that is important in this context. There are many ways to become a permanent resident in the US and thus get a &lt;em&gt;green card&lt;/em&gt;. Some of these ways involve getting sponsored by your employer. Some don’t. Basically, in some situations it would be the employer’s responsibility (Johns Hopkins University in this case) to be involved in and be supportive and in others I think that they are not obliged to help financially. You can have very different reactions to this story based on what mechanism Dr. Mahoney-Steel was asking Johns Hopkins University to help her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-portrayed-handling-of-dr.mahoney-steels-case-by-hopkins&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; handling of Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s case by Hopkins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; here because we currently don’t know Hopkins’ side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems to be the main reason why Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s case became a story is because she submitted her documents to request a renewal of her H-1B (highly specialized worker) visa to Johns Hopkins University’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://ois.jhu.edu/&#34;&gt;Office of International Services&lt;/a&gt;. She didn’t hear back from them until she heard in August 21st that they decided not to send her documents to the US government and that she should leave the country by August 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hugely disturbing and would be enough to grab the attention of many readers. This is what caught the attention of several colleagues at Hopkins. We haven’t really heard the story from OIS’ perspective and I would definitely want to know more&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of details in the article, we don’t know exactly which mechanism Dr. Mahoney-Steel was asking Hopkins to help her with. She might have been considering applying under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/employment-based&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;employed-based immigration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1&#34;&gt;EB-1&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2&#34;&gt;EB-2&lt;/a&gt;. For the EB-1 I think that your employer has to help you quite a bit. But not all employers want to do so. Also these processes take a considerable amount of time, not 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, maybe Dr. Mahoney-Steel was asking Hopkins to help her pay for her green card &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/immediate-relative-us-citizen&#34;&gt;application through family&lt;/a&gt; since she’s married to a US citizen and due to their &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; extremely poor communication on her H-1B visa renewal. I haven’t heard of any employer helping their employees with the green card fees in such cases. It’d be great if they did it, but I wouldn’t expect this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-portrayed-lack-of-attention-by-dr.mahoney-steel&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; lack of attention by Dr. Mahoney-Steel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we don’t know how everything exactly happened. My issues here could be based on how Dan Rodricks used his notes from interviewing Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the Mexicans I shared the article with are not US citizens&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and thus have different types of visas that allow us to study and/or work in the US. We learn fast, either through personal experience or stories from others, that you have to prioritize any visa paperwork you have to do. That involves lots of planning and attention to detail. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing when your visa expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning the types of visas you can apply to after your current one expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fees associated with the different visa applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements for the visa you want to get: timeline, documents that you have, documents that you need to get, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating with all parties involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this information at hand you can make plans. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ois.jhu.edu/&#34;&gt;OIS&lt;/a&gt; is also pretty helpful, in my experience, as they provide seminars where they explain a lot of this information and you can also request to meet with one of their specialists. OIS also sends reminders that prompt you to get moving: get your documents ready and send them on time. Having defended OIS based on my experience I also have to say that I’ve heard them make costly mistakes that affected friends of mine. Ultimately, the immigrant is responsible for their own application and has to double check everything others make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I have learned myself that if something says that it can take between 60 and 90 days, that I should think that it’ll take 90 days and be happy if it takes less than that. This doesn’t mean that our plans are the best or that they always work out. It just means that we try to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, as portrayed, I’m surprised by Dr. Mahoney-Steel because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She didn’t contact OIS a few days after sending her documents to follow up on her case. If she had, maybe she would have had more time to convince them to actually send her H-1B visa renewal documents to the US government, ask for help for her green card (EB-1, EB-2?, EB-2 NIW?), ask for her direct employer (Sheridan Libraries) to intervene, etc. Still, OIS should have immediately notified her that they weren’t going to send her H-1B documents to the US government!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She has been married to a US citizen for less than two years (but over one)… and didn’t get a green card via an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/immediate-relative-us-citizen&#34;&gt;application through family&lt;/a&gt;. To my understanding, that’s one of the cheapest and fastest ways&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to apply for a green card. If you can get a green card, then you can stop worrying about visas. Isn’t that something we all want? Yes, it’s not free. The I-485&lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fee &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/i-485&#34;&gt;is 1,225 USD for someone aged 14 to 78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn8&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref8&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Say that you are applying via EB2-NIW and hiring some lawyers, then you are looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wegreened.com/Legal-Fees&#34;&gt;5,000 USD or more in lawyer fees alone plus another 700 USD for the government&lt;/a&gt;. Given the large advantages that you get from having a green card and her husband’s situation, I would hope that many would have helped Dr. Mahoney-Steel raise 1,225 USD. Luckily for Dr. Mahoney-Steel, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/family/family-us-citizens/bringing-spouses-live-united-states-permanent-residents&#34;&gt;she can still apply for a green card through family even if she is living outside the US&lt;/a&gt;. I would hope that Johns Hopkins would be willing to hire her back then, or maybe even now and have her work remotely from the UK while the green card application is being processed (if Hopkins has a branch in Europe).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does seem like Hopkins realized that they made a mistake (as portrayed in the article) because they covered her flight back to England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry to say this, but it ultimately looks to me that Dr. Mahoney-Steel felt entitled and never expected to face immigration problems. Though again, that’s the current lens I have, that is, Dan Rodricks’ article and the infamous quote from her friends and colleagues. That’s why it would be useful to hear more from Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;closing-remarks&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that Dan Rodricks and/or the Baltimore Sun edits his article to remove any mentions about Mexicans, which as they stand currently are all negative and ultimately offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hope that we get some clarification from Johns Hopkins University Office of International Services. Depending on what happened, they might have to apologize to Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an immigrant in the US, I encourage you to plan ahead as much as you can anything related to visa paperwork. The current administration will make it as hard as they can to legally immigrate to the US, read for example this article: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.propublica.org/article/authorities-can-now-deny-visa-and-green-card-applications-without-giving-applicants-a-chance-to-fix-errors&#34;&gt;“Authorities Can Now Deny Visa and Green Card Applications Without Giving Applicants a Chance to Fix Errors”&lt;/a&gt;. But you don’t need to make it harder on yourself by lack of planning. Take advantage of all the resources you have at your employer (OIS in this case) and ask your fellow immigrants to share their knowledge with you. Double check every document because others (like your employer) might have made mistakes in a form or letter (basically don’t trust experts will do their job perfectly) because the US government will make you pay (in time, lost opportunities, etc) if you make a mistake. If you are thinking about getting a green card, you can start by checking websites &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visapro.com/green-cards/&#34;&gt;like this one that lists all the possible ways to get one&lt;/a&gt; and by checking the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/eligibility-categories&#34;&gt;USCIS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ll write a letter to the Baltimore Sun including a link to this post. But that’s for tomorrow September 20th 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two friends thought of this quote by &lt;a href=&#34;https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/martin-niemoeller-first-they-came-for-the-socialists&#34;&gt;Martin Niemöller&lt;/a&gt; (which I didn’t know myself):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;acknowledgements&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank those who I discussed this article with and corrected some of my facts. If you want me to name you let me know and I’ll edit this post. I didn’t because going the other way around (from named to anonymous) is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw the article as a photo that was shared by Hopkins colleagues. Dan Rodrick’s Facebook page also shows the article with the original title.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 09/19/2018 at 10 pm ET.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us are students, alumni or even staff members at Hopkins and affiliated institutes (like myself).&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they ever can share their story due to privacy restrictions.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can be a dual citizen.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn6&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will still take months, say about 11 to 13 months from what I’ve heard.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref6&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn7&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The form you submit to get a green card.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref7&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn8&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might need to cover about another 400 USD in fees to get the documents that show that you have all the vaccines you need if you go to a place like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.passporthealthusa.com/locations/md/baltimore/162/&#34;&gt;Passport Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref8&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;This is a joint blog post between &lt;a href=&#34;http://stephaniehicks.com&#34;&gt;Stephanie Hicks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/&#34;&gt;Leonardo Collado-Torres&lt;/a&gt;. We want to share with you our experience using Slack and why you should join us. This post is in an interview style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-19-using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication_files/slack-logo.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-slack&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Slack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[SH]&lt;/code&gt; Slack is a communication tool for &lt;em&gt;teams&lt;/em&gt;. The main idea is you have individual chat rooms (referred to as &lt;em&gt;channels&lt;/em&gt; that always begin with the # symbol), which are organized by topics. Traditionally, if an email is sent to everyone on your team, each person must decide how tag or organize emails in their account. In contrast, Slack provides the structure and organization for all users on the team. Each user clicks on a specific topic, or channel, and all the messages related to that topic are already there, thereby reducing the organizational burden. In a slack team used by academic department, topics can be anything from announcements of #conferences, #workshops, #jobs, #seminars, #working_groups, #good_reads, #food_alerts, #payroll, and #IT_help. You can write public messages in the individual channels or send private direct messages to anyone on your team. Everything in Slack is searchable (e.g. files, conversations, people). Finally, Slack includes a lot of functionality and integration with other useful tools such as Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-19-using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-19%20at%204.00.33%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[LCT]&lt;/code&gt; Slack is a website that provides access to a group of message channels bundled together in what they call a workspace. These channels can have specific purposes and different sets of members. Slack also provides many integrations with other software that we commonly use, like integration with GitHub, todo lists, Google Calendar, Google Docs, etc. The idea of using Slack is to keep your communications with close colleagues organized and make them more fluid than email. You might use the &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; channel for making broad announcements, such as an interesting talk from a guest. Then switch to a private channel with your 4 colleagues for that new secret project you are working on and discuss some ideas that would be useful to explore in more detail. And finally, switch to a one-on-one channel with your advisor and ask if you can meet for a few minutes that later today. Like many websites, Slack is also available as its own desktop and phone applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-you-use-slack&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do you use Slack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[SH]&lt;/code&gt; While I communicate with colleagues everyday on Slack, I think it’s important to distinguish between Slack and email. Both are important, I just use them for different purposes. I view communication on Slack to be for instant, real-time messaging and discussion to increase collaboration. These are usually short messages compassing a single idea. In contrast, I view email to be a slower, more deliberate medium. There is less expectation for immediate response. In both cases, you can always turn them off completely and enjoy some peace too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-19-using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-19%20at%204.04.08%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;versus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-19-using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-19%20at%204.04.18%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[LCT]&lt;/code&gt; I’m part of multiple Slack &lt;em&gt;workplaces&lt;/em&gt; (collections of channels and users) but I mostly use one with my genomics collaborators. There, we have a channel per project, some of which can be silent for weeks/months. But that’s ok, because I can always jump back to them and revise what we were talking about. We have a channel for R questions, one for the team that I’m a part of (Andrew Jaffe’s lab), one for organizing when and where to eat lunch, another one with the recount2 team, a diversity channel, one for our computing cluster JHPCE, among others. I also frequently ask and get asked questions on one-on-one channels with Andrew’s lab members and people elsewhere from our genomics workplace. I love using Twitter for networking in academia and keeping myself updated. So I also tend to share relevant news to specific channels I’m a part of. For the project specific channels I also use the integration with GitHub to keep everything in one place and reduce the chance of git merge issues :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-do-you-like-about-slack&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do you like about Slack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[SH]&lt;/code&gt; I recently transitioned from being a postdoctoral research fellow to an assistant professor. Many people warned me about the increase in the number of emails that I would receive. While that is certainly true, I would attribute Slack to being the biggest mitigator in reducing the number of emails that I have received. It reduces my email burden and increases communication between collaborators and colleagues. When an email sometimes seems too formal, Slack is &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for sending out quick messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[LCT]&lt;/code&gt; It greatly reduces the amount of emails and email chains. Also, I like having the option of more communication with all my colleagues than would be typically allowed via email. Like no one would like an email about some interesting R package tweet or emails about lunch. Also, it was very useful this past year when I advised two students. I could get them involved in different projects, get them observe how we do some things, but also provide them a space to ask me questions during the week outside of our weekly meeting slot. Ultimately, I like to be organized and Slack helps me stay organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;any-more-tips&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Any more tips?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[SH]&lt;/code&gt; I have found that the more I engage and write messages in channels on a Slack team, the more I get in return. As conversations flow in a given channel on a particular topic, I may or may not have anything useful to contribute. If it’s the former, I try to pass along links, advice, knowledge or whatever is appropriate. If it’s the latter, I still gain knowledge by being able to read other people’s responses and learning how others would have approached or solved a problem. Either way it’s a win-win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[LCT]&lt;/code&gt; Regardless of what channel you use, it’s important to keep your messages polite. Basically, following a code of conduct similar to &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/#coc&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. This is not the anonymous internet, here you are interacting with your colleagues and you have to be aware of biases you might have, otherwise you might perpetrate some problems &lt;a href=&#34;https://work.qz.com/1128150/your-companys-slack-is-probably-sexist/&#34;&gt;like sexism&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, you share the responsibility of making sure that your Slack workspace is a welcoming environment where anyone is allowed to ask questions. I also think that it’s very important to keep your boundaries clear between work and home. I highly recommend going to your &lt;em&gt;preferences&lt;/em&gt; and automatically disabling notifications outside work hours as shown below. That’s something you can’t do with Google Chat: yes, I might be available after work hours, but I want to choose whether to respond or not and I don’t want others to expect an immediate answer if they see me online.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;I recently participated for the first time in a silent retreat (6 hrs) as part of a &lt;em&gt;Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction&lt;/em&gt; course. I’ve really been enjoying this course and the experience of learning new ways (for me) to live better and enjoy life more. If you haven’t heard of &lt;em&gt;mindfulness&lt;/em&gt; before (like me a few months ago), &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; defines it as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one&amp;#39;s attention to
experiences occurring in the present moment, which can be developed
through the practice of meditation and other training.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In academia and science, but really anywhere, we can encounter many sources of stress (some examples below). We all deal with it in different ways and this MBSR course is just one that I’m liking right now and recommend. If there’s no course near you, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C4BA3UK&#34;&gt;Full Catastrophe Living&lt;/a&gt; book that my course is based on&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these tweets are threads, so you’ll have to open them to see them: click on the blue bird on the right side of each tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Thanks for sharing this Ted! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tladeras?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@tladeras&lt;/a&gt; As with anything, but particularly with mental health, I think it’s important to know you are not alone and that some things we feel have names: impostor syndrome, anxiety, depression, etc. Our minds are very powerful! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MentalHealthMatters?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#MentalHealthMatters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/X1UIAznV8f&#34;&gt;https://t.co/X1UIAznV8f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Dr. Leonardo Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1004478330257707008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the exercises on our silent retreat was &lt;em&gt;mindful eating&lt;/em&gt;. That is, eating slowly and focusing on our senses while eating food. This involved smelling the food, seeing all the colors it has, feeling all the different textures, and focusing on its taste. Plus, not talking to anyone. I had bought a lunch before the retreat (so I wouldn’t have to break the silence during it) that I normally don’t find interesting: some fruit and a chicken curry wrap from CVS. But wow, it was amazing that day! I greatly enjoyed how it tasted and all the different sensations I felt. I couldn’t believe it was the same food I had eaten other times before without much excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been processing some strong feelings related to feeling unwelcome, homesickness and loneliness. I’m doing many things that I know help me, starting with talking about them with my family. I’ve also been keeping myself busy doing some sports outside, going to events, bars, having friends over, etc. But what motivated me to write this post today is that after lunch I left really bad today. I had to go outside and try to calm myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-11-mindfulness_files/2018-06-11_13.25.34.jpg&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I did, returned to work, and nah, I couldn’t do it today. So I went home, rested in my room in the dark, and I find myself finishing this post about 2 hours later. I’m not sure it’s related to the MSBR course, but I’m wondering if the mindfulness practice is also opening my mind’s ears and eyes to my inner feelings way more than normal&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t think it’s bad. It’s just that it’s way harder to enjoy this process than it was eating a lunch. I’m trying to feel happy because I have feelings and I’m recognizing them. My family is also happy because they view it as a part of maturing and that I’m getting ready for taking another step in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just some things are taking me way more time than normal. For example, it took me 2 days to process what I wanted to reply to a tweet and how to word it: it turned out well because I think we all heard each other ^^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Thanks for the link &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@apreshill&lt;/a&gt;! I agree that the blog post was aweful! You can’t blame X for the fact that X is marginalized. However, I disagree with the notion that Z can’t talk about X (challenging). I’m in favor of inclusion. Otherwise that line of thought leads to xenophobia&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Dr. Leonardo Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1006207918813958145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also discovered that the silent retreat reminded me of vacations where I turn off my phone/email and spend a few days thinking about what’s next. I used to go to Mexico every 6 months or so during my PhD to recharge. I want to do it again, but I can’t. That lead me to my strong feelings of homesickness I had today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to close, I’m OK. I appreciate all the support I have and I recommend others to learn about mindfulness. You might be missing out some super tasty lunches and/or an exploration trip towards your inner self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to add that I know some of you might see this post as over-sharing (yes, it might be). One reply is that I think that leaders also have to show their vulnerable sides. This has been debated a lot in academic twitter accounts in the context of showing your failures too, not just your successes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>End of the summer blogger challenge</title>
      <link>/2014/10/03/kiva/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/2014/10/03/kiva/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer a few of us at 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://bmorebiostat.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bmore Biostats&lt;/a&gt; agreed to a summer iron blogger challenge. We either had to blog every week or every two weeks. The penalty of not publishing a post in our chosen timeframe was to donate 5 or 10 USD (respectively) to our charity of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the idea of the blogging challenge and thought it would help me keep motivated to keep my blog active during the summer. However, I totally failed and only posted twice during the 16 week summer. That is, I have to donate 14 * 5 = 70 USD. I think that most of us blogged a lot less than what we were hoping to and potentially owe a charity some money. But well, there is no real obligation to donate and I don&amp;rsquo;t expect others to do so. However, I want to do it. Doing so will help me take a iron blogger challenge more seriously next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kiva&#34;&gt;Kiva&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a charity of my choice, I ended up choosing 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiva.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kiva&lt;/a&gt;. Through them you can loan 25 USD to an individual or group that needs the money to improve their business, home, etc. And in general, you get your money back. Alternatively, you can donate your money from the get go or keep re-loaning it instead of withdrawing it back to your bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;900&#34; height=&#34;506&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/lSN2WdqXwfc?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my first time doing something like this, so I am going to ask for the money back and then re-loan it as I see fit. So, because strictly speaking I am not donating it, I decided to increase my entry to 100 USD. That is, 4 Kiva loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiva recommends lending to different individuals, Kiva partners, and countries to diversify your risk. Being born in Mexico, I wanted to specifically help people from there. If you 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiva.org/lend#/?perPage=20&amp;amp;countries%5B%5D=MX&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;restrict the search to Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, currently there are 13 open loans. From them, I chose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiva.org/lend/773040&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Aurea&lt;/a&gt; administered by 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiva.org/partners/301&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eblock International&lt;/a&gt;. She wants to install a floor in her room. It seems like she has used other Kiva loans to slowly build her house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiva.org/lend/775645&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sonia&lt;/a&gt; administered by 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiva.org/partners/294&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kubo Financiero&lt;/a&gt;. She wants to buy recycling materials for her business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiva.org/lend/774187&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mujeres Mazahuas Group&lt;/a&gt; who are re-stocking their grocery business. The loan is administered by 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiva.org/partners/130&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;VisionFund Mexico&lt;/a&gt; who have gotten loans for over 6 million since 2009. That&amp;rsquo;s a large chunk of the 16 million that Kiva has sent to Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiva.org/lend/774355&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gabino&lt;/a&gt; administered by 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiva.org/partners/226&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sistema Biobolsa&lt;/a&gt;. He wants a biodigester which will help him in his agriculture business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the loans will be used properly! But like my friend who has experience in micro-banks in Mexico tells me, it is very hard to know that. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the meantime, here is my receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

      <title>&#34;I am a writer&#34; exercise</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not have a clear memory of when I started to write or in which language it was. My first written words might have been in English since I lived in Boston (USA) three years during my early childhood. By age five I was back in Mexico and that is where I am sure I wrote my first full homeworks. During elementary school, I changed languages once more—this time to French. By middle school, I started to be interested in two new types of languages. One was mathematics which I liked, but which I didn&amp;#8217;t consider till much later. The other was related to computers as I learnt the very basics of HTML—that&amp;#8217;s all I know so far. In college—having reverted back to Spanish and English—and in my current stage in graduate school, I am a writer because I write—I mainly typeset using &lt;code&gt;LaTeX&lt;/code&gt;—my homeworks, code in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, and summarize findings in reports. For the past year, I have been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;Fellgernon Bit&lt;/a&gt; to practice writing and hopefully improve my skills. Furthermore, for me the process of writing helps me clarify my thoughts and organize them before attempting to communicate them. Sometimes it works, others it doesn&amp;#8217;t. Finally, I am a writer because it is crucial in the academic environment to be able to communicate through the printed word. This is tricky because sometimes you want to be very short, direct but not leave anything important out, like when emailing a professor. Other times, you have to be very precise and clear yet tell an interesting story such as when writing a scientific report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I consider myself a writer in training and would like to improve. But as with everything, practice is key. That&amp;#8217;s a big part of why I blog and why I&amp;#8217;m enrolled in this course.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>And so begins English Composition I</title>
      <link>/2013/03/21/and-so-begins-english-composition-i/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/2013/03/21/and-so-begins-english-composition-i/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week started the English Composition I: Achieving Expertise course (&lt;span class=&#34;showtooltip&#34; title=&#34;(2013). Coursera.  https://www.coursera.org/ [Online.  last-accessed: 2013-03-21 03:47:13].   https://www.coursera.org/course/composition.&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/composition&#34;&gt;Comer, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) that I have been looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure yet how long I will last, but I hope to enjoy it as much as I can. Plus, it should help me with my posting and other writing areas. While I last in the course, I plan to publish my writings in the blog too. So you will hopefully see me be more active here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is important to cite when writing, I have also figured out how to do so automatically in Rmd files. For that I learnt how to use &lt;strong&gt;knitcitations&lt;/strong&gt; from the GitHub instructions (&lt;span class=&#34;showtooltip&#34; title=&#34;cboettig (2013). knitcitations.   https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations [Online. last-accessed:  2013-03-21 03:19:44].   https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations.&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations&#34;&gt;knitcitations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and a explanatory post (&lt;span class=&#34;showtooltip&#34; title=&#34;Boettiger C (2013). knitcitations.   http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html  [Online. last-accessed: 2013-03-21 02:15:41].   http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html.&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html&#34;&gt;Boettiger, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;knitcitations&lt;/strong&gt; is great, but it kind of struggles with some pages. That is why I modified my template in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lcolladotor/FBit&#34;&gt;FBit&lt;/a&gt; by writing my own citing function for pages where &lt;code&gt;citep&lt;/code&gt; fails. Here is the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;## I made my own citing function since citep() doesn&#39;t work like I want to with
## urls that are not really pages themselve like part of a GitHub repo.
mycitep &amp;lt;- function(x, short, year=substr(date(), 21, 24), tooltip=TRUE) {
	tmp &amp;lt;- citep(x)
	res &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, paste0(&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, short, &amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot;), tmp)
	if(tooltip) {
		res &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;\\?\\?\\?\\?&amp;quot;, year, res)
	}
	res
}

## You already saw an inline working example in the post itself.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
