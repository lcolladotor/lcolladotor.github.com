&lt;p&gt;Note: the Fall event will be student and post doc only while the Spring event will be open to the whole department. This is to smooth the integration process for the new students. A survey showed that at least some first year students would be more likely to either attend or present if it&amp;rsquo;s a student-only event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epi vs Biostat Kickball match Spring 2013</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/04/24/epi-vs-biostat-kickball-match-spring-2013/</link>

      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/04/24/epi-vs-biostat-kickball-match-spring-2013/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past Saturday the Epi and Biostat troops met for another fun kickball match. Obviously Biostat beat Epi, yup I know: again! This time the score was 15-8 (according to our bookkeeper and captain John) or 12-8 (according to some in Epi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a hint of a surprise at the beginning when Epi scored two runs in the top of the first inning. However, the tide changed back with a homerun by Rumen. Sadly, one of the Epi players got injured and carried out of the court in that play. Rumen also pulled his quad with the big hit and was limited for the rest of the match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that inning on forth we saw both teams having fun kicking the ball as far as we could or aim for in between the defensive lines. There were plenty of sacrifice hits, some occasional errors, but overall we had a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Both teams picture&#34; src=&#34;http://biostat.jhsph.edu/%7Elcollado/misc/Kickball2013/images/2013_04_20_16_55_15.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both teams came prepared to show their colors: them in red us in purple with some face paint for the sport battle (thanks to Aaron). However, the Epi crew did surprise us by bringing a big grill to the park and lots of food!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the match, we all mingled together and enjoyed the nice (a bit chilly) day outside in the company of some drinks and food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us then continued our journey at Kislings where we played other games that involve loads of cups and some ping pong balls ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://biostat.jhsph.edu/%7Elcollado/misc/Kickball2013/index.html&#34;&gt;view all the pictures here&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any other pictures that you want to share, send them my way!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#34;Do analytics really tell the whole story?&#34;</title>

      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/03/31/do-analytics-really-tell-the-whole-story/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article-1/Do-analytics-really-tell-the-whole-story/86248baa-e8ec-4772-a0df-7693676812be?campaign=FB130330&#34;&gt;Do analytics really tell the whole story?&lt;/a&gt;&#34; by Vic Ketchman explores how analytics is used nowadays in the NFL draft. The entry point is the &#34;Moneyball&#34; movie and Ketchman&amp;#8217;s piece is mainly a digested interview to Tony Villiotti from draftmetrics.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is analytics? It’s the accumulation of meaningful patterns in data, for the purpose of using that data to predict future results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of the wording used, but well, the point they make is that they use data to predict the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main issue with this article is that after the previous quote Ketchman pretty much describes some of the data. Description of the data—in my opinion—is part of what we call EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis. &lt;span&gt;The data is interesting, but there are really not many predictions made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m also concerned by how some of the data is presented. For example, is the 37.1 percent rate of starts by first-round picks really different form 35.5 for the teams with losing records? Plus, it&amp;#8217;s data from only a single year! So I think that it&amp;#8217;s not enough to actually answer any question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end my comment, Ketchman asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you like those analytics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t like them much. Sure, some of numbers presented are interesting but the &amp;#8216;analytics&amp;#8217; are far from being great. &lt;span&gt;Though I bet Villiotti has more interesting results that are only seen by the NFL teams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Citi ThankYou ballon TV commercial looks like a ripoff of Hello Kitty in Space</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know about you, but I think that this new &amp;#8220;Citi ThankYou Cards&amp;#8221; TV commercial is trying to ride the popularity train from the &amp;#8220;HELLO KITTY IN SPACE&amp;#8221; video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/5qZQ0POmpkM?rel=0&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/5REsCTG4-Gg?rel=0&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hm&amp;#8230; it looks like a ripoff, smells like a ripoff, tastes like a ripoff&amp;#8230; is it a ripoff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just flattery, maybe it&amp;#8217;s imitation, or maybe it&amp;#8217;s copyright infringement. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

Totally what happened to me on Monday night! (whenever I saved this post as a draft :P, but it’s happening again now)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Homepage photos: which cheek you show says something?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;John Bohannon wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/08/scientists-photos-reveal-their.html&#34;&gt;Scientists&amp;#8217; Photos Reveal Their Inner Mr. Spock&lt;/a&gt; which I found funny in a science-curious kind of way. I hadn&amp;#8217;t thought about the message you could be sending depending on which cheek you show. I had only noticed that people like to show more serious-looking photos of themselves and sometimes make it an obviously funny one. I have to say too that some of the pages from my co-workers don&amp;#8217;t even show a picture. I guess that&amp;#8217;s a more recent trend to make it more &amp;#8220;professional&amp;#8221; looking. Dunno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to guess that dead center-looking pictures are rare. At least when you look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/staff/index.php?id=RJ002&#34;&gt;Rachael Jack&amp;#8217;s one&lt;/a&gt; it stands out. It reminds me of passport pictures. For my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/index.html#.UD-xBmie5us&#34;&gt;new academic site&lt;/a&gt; I choose one that doesn&amp;#8217;t look serious, I wanted a fun one! Plus I make it obvious which country I&amp;#8217;m from ^^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason this doesn&amp;#8217;t surprise me:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;while English language and literature scholars showed the left cheek and engineers showed the right, psychologists were more difficult to categorize. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
