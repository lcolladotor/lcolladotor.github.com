      <description>

&lt;p&gt;My advisor recently asked me to fill a career planning document (he&amp;rsquo;ll blog about it at some point) that has lots of questions and is being very useful. Trying to fill answer all these questions has gotten me thinking about other important things for the future. Two of them being reasonable expectations for work hours and salary in a biostats/genomics academic career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find these questions hard to answer and even hard to talk about, and if you know me, I&amp;rsquo;m a person that asks lots of questions. I have also been advised against talking about these subjects during a first interview because it&amp;rsquo;s important to focus on the research environment. I agree that you should find a place to work that you like with problems that will keep you motivated, and with colleagues that make your daily life enjoyable &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27218&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/04/happiness-at-work_n_6613358.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000063&#39;&gt;Hall, 2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I still want to have a reasonable idea about what to expect. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to ask these questions, it&amp;rsquo;s also hard to blog about it. These questions are not really what others encourage you to talk about &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27219&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27220&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2015/01/30/scientific-blogging-why-it-might-just-be-good-for-your-cv&#39;&gt;Gould, 2015&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#39;http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2014/09/18/science-blogging&#39;&gt;Gould, 2014&lt;/a&gt;) but I think that I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one with these questions in mind and that others might benefit from this post. Well, I hope they will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t ask myself these questions before doing a PhD. It felt natural that doing a PhD would open the door for more opportunities in academia than going to work after undergrad or a masters. Even for a career outside science which a bit more than half (53%) of UK science PhD students choose to follow &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27232&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2014/10/03/the-postdoc-decision&#39;&gt;Gould, 2014&lt;/a&gt;), getting a PhD likely gives a strong boost to your career options. But when you start considering a postdoc, there is an opportunity cost &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27233&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;) associated to it because you could be earning more at a non-academic job. But how much are we talking about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/files/2014/09/Scientific-century.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/files/2014/09/Scientific-century.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Careers&#34; style=&#34;width: 771px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture from &amp;ldquo;The postdoc decision&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#39;http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2014/10/03/the-postdoc-decision&#39;&gt;Gould, 2014&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the opportunity cost of doing a postdoc, for a career in academia you will likely want to do a postdoc to get a chance at a tenure-track job, specially in fields like biology. For a career outside academia but still research related, I think that doing a postdoc could increase your chances at getting a better job. In any case, you have to consider all career options when doing a postdoc &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27223&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.nature.com/news/there-is-life-after-academia-1.15808&#39;&gt;, 2014&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;salary-what-to-expect&#34;&gt;Salary: what to expect&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a postdoc, the NIH sets training stipends which sets a baseline &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27234&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.nationalpostdoc.org/policy/briefing-room/191-nih-stipend-freeze&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;). For example, 42k per year in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For later, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amstat.org/careers/salaryinformation.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ASA: Career Resources for Statisticians&lt;/a&gt; has information for biostatistics departments. For example, the median year 0 assistant professor in a biostatistics department made 102k &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27228&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2014/01/01/academic-salary-survey-2/&#39;&gt;megan, 2014&lt;/a&gt;). From this survey data you can get an idea of the salary progression through your academic career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I find the Life Sciences Salary Survey (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/38033/title/2013-Life-Sciences-Salary-Survey/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41316/title/2014-Life-Sciences-Salary-Survey/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;) informative. In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.the-scientist.com/Nov2014/11_14_SalarySurveyforWeb.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2014 detailed pdf&lt;/a&gt; you can see that a male postdoc average pay was $46,372, $79,616 for an assistant professor, $107,868 for associate professors, and $158,059 for professors. That last figure is smaller than $169,900 which is the median salary for year 0 professors in biostatistics (&lt;a href=&#39;http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2014/01/01/academic-salary-survey-2/&#39;&gt;megan, 2014&lt;/a&gt;). The 2014 Life Sciences survey also has average salaries by age. So you can make three different progressions of your career salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-should-you-care&#34;&gt;Why should you care?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably many reasons why you should care about your salary given two or more equally good work opportunities. In my case, I wanted to get a rough idea if an academic career would be able to pay for my desired lifestyle and life goals. Let me explain this in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From looking at the retirement for doctoral scientists report &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27230&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf11302/&#39;&gt;Foundation, 2015&lt;/a&gt;) retiring between 66 and 70 years old seems like a common scenario. Then from the life expectancy calculator &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27235&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.socialsecurity.gov/cgi-bin/longevity.cgi&#39;&gt;OACT, 2015&lt;/a&gt;), it seems that for someone like me the average life expectancy is 87 years and retiring from work at 67 years. That is, about 37 years of work and 20 years of retirement. Then, the average cost of a house is about 320k &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27236&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2014/01/new-home-prices-new-record-for-average.html&#39;&gt;McBride, 2014&lt;/a&gt;). If you get a house loan for 270k at 4% interest rate for 30 years and 1.25% property tax you would pay 190k in interest and 120k in tax &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Unknown_2015&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.mortgagecalculator.org/&#39;&gt;Unknown, 2015&lt;/a&gt;). Federal income tax is about 28% &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27237&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/tax-planning/quick-tax-rate-calculator.aspx&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;) (I know it&amp;rsquo;s more complicated) with about 5% for state tax &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27238&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/state-taxes-massachusetts.aspx&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;). So about 33% of your income goes to paying taxes. The cost for having a car is about 10k a year &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27239&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/16/aaa-car-ownership-costs/2070397/&#39;&gt;Larry Copeland, 2013&lt;/a&gt;) although you could probably save some money by getting a smaller car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that I want to have children in the future, and if I do, I would like to afford their education. It seems that the cost of raising a child to age 18 is about 575k if you spend about 120k in private college &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27240&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.babycenter.com/cost-of-raising-child-calculator&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;). Those numbers include the cost of adapting your house (but not interests in mortgage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to be able to travel quite a bit, and given that these are all US numbers, I would also like to go to Mexico frequently. Anyhow, setting about 5k a year for traveling is an ambitious goal. Alternatively, the 5k could help mitigate any unforeseen emergency, like a surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can use the numbers from all three academic career salary progressions to get an idea of how my life goals fit in and the impact they would have on my lifestyle. For the average salary for life sciences by age I&amp;rsquo;m using the numbers from 30 to 67 years old. For average salary for life sciences by career stage I&amp;rsquo;ll use 2 years for postdoc, 7 years for assistant professor, 8 for associate professor and the remaining 20 as a professor. For the progression for biostatistics departments in research universities I simply adapted the above numbers to the greater data resolution available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at my mint.com budget I see that I spend about 1370 a month on everything except rent. I like my current lifestyle and would like to keep it throughout my life, obviously adapting it to my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Monthly difference between costs for idealized life and current life style (1370 a month) using different salary progression data. That is, how much you can save per month for other misc expenses.&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; NoChild &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; OneChild &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; TwoChild &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt; average &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; 316 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; -525 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; -1366 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt; tenure &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; 1037 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; 197 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; -644 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt; biostats &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; 2263 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; 1422 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt; 581 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in the previous table only the life sciences tenure and biostats progressions can handle my life goals without sacrificing my life style if I had one child. Two children only seems feasible in the biostats salary progression. These numbers give a general idea, but it&amp;rsquo;s way more information than I had before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I&amp;rsquo;m assuming that your savings can keep up with inflation. Plus, I don&amp;rsquo;t have student loans thanks to receiving my education at UNAM-Mexico, but I know that this isn&amp;rsquo;t true for many US citizens. You could probably do a bit better than I projected if you invested and got a higher return than inflation, got promoted faster, moved to a country with a lower cost of living after saving some money, or had to borrow less money for buying the house. This last point could certainly be feasible if you managed to earn more money early in your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;work-hours-what-to-expect&#34;&gt;Work hours: what to expect&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering this question has been much harder than the salary question. First, lets look outside of science. A recent news article &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27243&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_WORKAHOLIC_JAPAN&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;) says: &amp;ldquo;About 22 percent of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16 percent of Americans, 11 percent of the French and Germans, according to data compiled by the Japanese government.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different survey shows that 39 percent of full time employed US workers work beyond 49 hours per week with the average being 47 hours &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27247&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-leadership/wp/2014/09/02/the-average-work-week-is-now-47-hours/&#39;&gt;@jenamcgregor, 2014&lt;/a&gt;). Broadly summarized government data shows lower averages &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27248&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t18.htm&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;). Anyhow, I think that it&amp;rsquo;s likely that work hours for researchers are in the upper half. I&amp;rsquo;m also under the impression that most scientists work beyond the official working time (check &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also agree with the idea that work hours fluctuate, for example with weeks when grants are due reaching high peaks. Also, probably a lot of people haven&amp;rsquo;t tracked their hours &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27249&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/you-do-not-need-to-work-80-hours-a-week-to-succeed-in-academia/&#39;&gt;@DynamicEcology, 2014&lt;/a&gt;). In my case, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rescuetime.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RescueTime&lt;/a&gt; I know that I have spent about 45-50 hours per week on my work computer recently (I only have the free version, so I can&amp;rsquo;t go back too far in time). Though I do get distracted at times and my &amp;ldquo;productivity pulse&amp;rdquo; is around 60 to 70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t think that scientists should be expected to routinely work 60+ hours a week. There&amp;rsquo;s even a 1943 (wartime) paper arguing that &amp;ldquo;For men a working week in excess of 60 hours usually leads to no increase in production, and for women the hours should never exceed 54&amp;rdquo; (see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v151/n3841/pdf/151651a0.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;). But teaching loads can certainly push to higher work loads as this particular story shows &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27250&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.insidehighered.com:80/advice/2013/04/22/essay-hours-faculty-members-work-each-day&#39;&gt;, 2013&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that 45-50 hours per week should be reasonable with a good work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, &amp;ldquo;postdocs should expect to work longer-than-average hours&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;We put in the hours we do because it is highly competitive out there&amp;rdquo; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27253&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2011/04/01/are-long-working-hours-inevitable-for-postdocs&#39;&gt;Gould, 2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, it seems that research could be a 9-5 job and achieving it &amp;ldquo;requires good planning, effective teamwork and a supportive environment&amp;rdquo; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27252&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2014/12/18/ask-the-expert-can-research-ever-be-a-9-5-job&#39;&gt;Gould, 2014&lt;/a&gt;). This ties in with some of my thoughts: I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s all about being efficient as you can be and indeed having a great work team. So yes, when looking for a job it is very important to find a job with the right research and support environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-should-you-care-1&#34;&gt;Why should you care?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that it&amp;rsquo;s important to know this information so you can have realistic expectations of your stress level and work-life balance. If you underestimate the work load, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably be uncomfortable to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think that it&amp;rsquo;s dangerous to ignore this question even when you are highly motivated by your work and easily lose track of time spent working. That is, I assume that many scientists are motivated by their work but I argue that they should still think about their life outside work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternative-way-to-count&#34;&gt;Alternative way to count&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/STREPchanges_1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/STREPchanges_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sleep&#34; style=&#34;width: 771px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture from the Sleep Foundation &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27251&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to take a look at this question is to see how would you like to spend your time outside work. Seems like a good recommendation is to sleep 8 hours per day. Spending about 4 hours per day with your family seems like a good goal &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27254&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.circleofmoms.com/question/how-much-time-do-you-spend-your-child-day-1701015&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;) although many people can&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27255&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.babycenter.com/viewPollResults.htm?pollId=1527797&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;) despite &amp;ldquo;spending quality family time together is very important&amp;rdquo; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27256&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/spending_quality_family_time_together_is_very_important&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;). If you exercise about 1 hour a day, take about 1 hour to get ready in the morning, spend 1 hour commuting, and 1 hour cooking/having dinner that leaves you with 8 hours per day for work. With school taking about 6 hours, this seems doable if your work allows you to work from home for 2 hours or so. Such a schedule would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake up at 6:30, exercise 1 hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get ready: 1 hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commute: 30 min. You get to work at 9 am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work 6 hours until 3pm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commute: 30 min&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family time 2 hrs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dinner 1 hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family time 2 hrs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work 2 more hours: 8:30 to 10:30pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep 8 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I think about it, it seems like my advisor is doing something along these lines. Well, he is likely sleeping much less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this type of workday, you would have to work 5-10 hours on the weekend to get to 45-50 work hours per week. Seems doable and reasonable to me. Working beyond 50 hours a week would most likely mean that you&amp;rsquo;d have to sacrifice family and exercise time. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem healthy but I understand that it might be needed at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when ideas that at first might seem unreasonable start to make some sense. For example, James W. Vaupel suggested working 25 hours a week and retiring later in life so young people get more time with their kids &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27257&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://sciencenordic.com/we-should-only-work-25-hours-week-argues-professor&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning what to expect in terms of salary and work hours for a biostats/genomics career in academia is challenging and time consuming. At best you depend on surveys which may be biased, information from commercial sites and blog posts. However, with salary progression tables you can get a broad idea of how realistic your life goals and lifestyle expectations are. Although it would be great to have more data and data from other countries. For example, I don&amp;rsquo;t have and haven&amp;rsquo;t looked for the salary progression data in Mexico: maybe salaries are lower but due to lower costs of living you might be better off there than in the US assuming that the research environment is as good or better. That is a question for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found some answers which I hope will be useful later on. From the salary perspective, I find it motivating that this career could fund my goals and lifestyle, specially in a Biostatistics department from a research university. From the work hours perspective, at least I have some information to support my previously vague idea that 45-50 hours a week is reasonable. Whether that&amp;rsquo;s enough is yet to be seen. Specially with how competitive it can be to get an academic position and complete the progression to becoming a professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if tools like the PI predictor &lt;a id=&#39;cite-greycite27259&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.pipredictor.com/&#39;&gt;, 2015&lt;/a&gt;) say that I have a 10% chance of becoming a PI (data up to nov 2014), I have encountered that all my life: 10% of LCG applicants who passed UNAM&amp;rsquo;s exam got into my undergrad, 10% of applicants got into my PhD program. So it&amp;rsquo;s old news and I just have to keep working to beat the odds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keeping in touch (ENAR2014?) and philosophical questions regarding México&#39;s future in genomics</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/06/12/keeping-in-touch-enar2014-and-philosophical</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/06/12/keeping-in-touch-enar2014-and-philosophical</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following text is an email I sent to several of my friends from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/about&#34;&gt;LCG undergraduate program &lt;/a&gt;I studied. There I talk about keeping in touch, I invite them to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.enar.org/meetings.cfm&#34;&gt;ENAR 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and also talk about some philosophical questions regarding our future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m posting it here because I don&amp;#8217;t mind sharing these thoughts and because I don&amp;#8217;t have the current email addresses of many former LCG students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hola a todos,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les escribo por el gusto de mantener el contacto, por razones académicas, y también por un rollo filosófico / a futuro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contacto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como ya les dije, me da mucho gusto escribirles. Cuando lo hago sé que generalmente resulta en mails largos, así que intentando ser corto, siento que hoy termina el ciclo de personas que conocí en la LCG. Digo, hoy se gradua la 7ma generación y realmente no conozco las nuevas. Fueron años muy buenos los que viví con todos allá en Cuerna y ojalá podamos mantener cierto vínculo a través de los años. Sé que cuesta. Por ejemplo, no tengo los correos de algunos (o no los encontré vía google), otros los intenté adivinar vía &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/titulados&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/titulados&#34;&gt;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/titulados&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; y la regla de 8 caracteres, y solo pocos lo siguen teniendo en su página de Facebook (por rollos de seguridad). También soy bastante malo para escribir regularmente (ya sea vía email o mis blogs: &lt;a href=&#34;http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;académico&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;más personal&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Este año en especial he disfrutado (y seguiré disfrutando) mucho de ver a algunos aunque sea un par de horas =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;También me gusta mucho cuando me piden ayuda sobre algo, aunque sea lento en contestar :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENAR 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De lo académico, les quiero avisar que en 2014 van a organizar acá en Baltimore el congreso ENAR (Eastern North American Regional) en marzo del 2014. Es un congreso de bioestadística con una buena parte enfocada a la genómica. Y bueno, muchas cosas hechas en R. Mi jefe está organizando un par de las sesiones así que si tienen sugerencias de quienes invitar avísenme. Ustedes mismos ^_&lt;em&gt;^ &lt;/em&gt;(hay un buen número de pláticas por alumnos de posgrado &amp;amp; postdocs), sus jefes, etc. En fin, tal vez les interese el congreso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De 2014 no hay mucha info aún &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.enar.org/meetings.cfm&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.enar.org/meetings.cfm&#34;&gt;http://www.enar.org/meetings.cfm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, pero allí pueden ver lo que pasó en otros años.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rollos filosóficos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El rollo filosófico / a futuro tiene que ver con:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;&lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;¿Qué condiciones piden para trabajar en México?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;¿Cómo crear un vínculo más fuerte entre egresados LCG?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;¿A qué dedicarse? ¿Academia? ¿Industria? ¿Otra cosa?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Del punto (1) lo he platicado con algunos pero creo que es un tema interesante y muy variado. Hay aspectos que tal vez están fuera de nuestro alcance como la seguridad, y hay otros como el ambiente de trabajo y de la ciencia. El rollo de plazas y los esfuerzos de algunos por crear espacios: CCG tiene algunas ahorita, Palacios &amp;amp; Dávila están haciendo un plan grande para repatriar ex-LCGs, el INMEGEN &amp;amp; el CINVESTAV han estado creciendo, o la idea de hacer un plan nosotros. Ojo, a penas me enteré que para tener plaza de investigador en la UNAM te piden tener un postdoc de 2 años: el chiste es que tengas publicaciones &amp;amp; hayas demostrado que la puedes hacer en la ciencia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¿Sacrificas potencial académico trabajando en México? Dicho de otra forma, ¿cómo te afecta: el rollo del idioma, el de competir en condiciones que parecen ser más difíciles, o el de tener menos colaboradores cerca para crecer con su crítica &amp;amp; datos de última tecnología? O irse fuera de México (no hay por que ser mártir) y sentirse a gusto con esa decisión. Siempre hay formas de colaborar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Del punto (2) yo opino que puede ser a través de comentar artículos con gente ex-LCG involucrada (algo así &lt;a href=&#34;http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/post/45152484977/commenting-scientific-papers#.UbjBemTF1d8&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;describí aquí&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), o tal vez vía &lt;a href=&#34;http://masciencia.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Más Ciencia por México&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (no los logré convencer en esto de comentar artículos). Digo, también ayudaría que &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/titulados&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/titulados&#34;&gt;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/titulados&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tenga ligas a las páginas actuales de cada quien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Del (3), en mi opinión cubre también todo el rollo de si queremos vivir con &amp;#8220;soft-money&amp;#8221; a través del ciclo de donativos (el pay-line es 10% en EUA ahorita por lo de sequester), de la libertad académica (¿es una realidad o una forma de cautivarnos?), y también depende del tipo de industria. Otra forma de ver este punto es ¿cual es el nivel de estrés con el que estamos dispuestos a vivir? ¿A qué aspiramos? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En fin, dan ganas de organizar alguna reunión de ex-LCGs!! Mientras, a seguir con estudios &amp;amp; disfrutar la chamba (investigación o lo que estén haciendo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si me preguntan que busco con este correo, es simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;ul1&#34;&gt;&lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;Mantener el contacto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;Invitarlos a ENAR 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;Promover discusión en estos temas filosóficos / a futuro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saludos,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PD Perdón, terminó siendo un mail largo :P&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What does it take to be a good leader?</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/06/12/What-does-it-take-to-be-a-good-leader</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/06/12/What-does-it-take-to-be-a-good-leader</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leader: scientific or project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind before trying to answer this question I have to define &lt;strong&gt;leader&lt;/strong&gt;. Right now I have two —possibly conflicting— leaders in mind. One is a scientific leader in the sense of a leader in a specific scientific discipline. The other is a leader who can organize and lead projects, either scientific ones (across labs for example) or what I want to call revolutionary projects. With such a grandiose name I am trying to cover the type of projects that can help change a country. However, in reality this second type of leader is closer to administrative roles in leading academic institutions, like the chair of a department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good leader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do we say that a &lt;em&gt;leader&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;good leader&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the project leader (second type), I believe that the key is that a good leader gets the job done. The job might have some flaws, but this type of leader can lead a team to produce results. The next aspect you might want to request from a good leader is that they get the job done efficiently (time, resources). However, I would argue that another important characteristic is reducing (minimizing if we were to consider it a mathematical function) internal tensions (frictions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the scientific leader, I struggle more to define it. Is a good scientific leader someone that produces good ideas and publishes them in a timely manner? Is it measured by their ability to secure research funds? Or is it that during their lifetime they had one brilliant idea that changed a field? Or is it just a measure of the number of citations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common aspects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that one of the most important skills both types of leaders should have is the ability to write clearly. If you cannot write clearly, then you cannot communicate your ideas properly. Without communicating your ideas, you cannot convince anyone that your research work is interesting or that your project is going to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I think that the ability to listen to others and synthesize their ideas is important for both types of leaders. If you cannot listen to others, you will be left alone pretty soon. But you cannot be involved in meetings all day long, so being able to quickly understand and keep the key points others are telling you (what I called synthesize) will be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that another important trait is being able to manage some important details secretly but still being able to discuss them with others at some level where you get useful feedback. Said in a different way, you want to test if your idea sounds good but you don&amp;#8217;t want to spill the beans and let everyone jump on it before you are ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diverging aspects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I strongly believe that frequent communication helps reduce the internal frictions. You have to tell what is the next step in the plan, keep everyone involved, but you also have to listen to what others are telling you. While I think that frequent communication helps a lot in a lab environment or when leading a project, again I am not sure that it is something a good scientific leader has. But I know that it is something I aspire to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then wonder if good oral communication skills are required for good leaders. I think that the answer is a definite yes for good scientific leaders, who after all frequently expose their work at conferences. But a project leader might not need such type of skill. Sure, they give speeches here and there but probably talk less in front of audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am certainly separating the ability to talk one-on-one or one-to-a-small-group (like in a table) from good oral communication skills. For me the latter are related to talking in front of audiences while the former are strongly based on the person&amp;#8217;s social skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to become a good leader?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is really the question that I am currently asking myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For writing, I think that practicing is very important. That is one of the key reasons why I like to blog and do so in English. As for listening to others, well, I am not sure how to proceed. The secrecy aspect of things is certainly one of my weakest points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequent communication is something that I think I am decent at doing and the key for me is good email managing skills. I am obviously practicing by trying to write shorter (more concise) emails and keeping my inbox as empty as possible following most of the tips given on &lt;a href=&#34;http://xph.us/2013/01/22/inbox-zero-for-life.html&#34;&gt;Inbox Zero for Life&lt;/a&gt; by Keith Rarick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overall, I wonder if I should take some courses beyond my scientific discipline of interest if I want to be a good leader. Writing? Maybe. I tried a Coursera course and failed to keep up during the comprehensive exam study season. Some kind of managing projects class? Hm…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you also need to learn to be patient to be a good leader? After all, my motivation takes a big hit when I have to deal with people I would rather not. I am also not so patient with those that complain without proposing alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess that I am at the stage where I am seeking all the feedback I can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Have you been &#39;relative stupid&#39;?</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/03/31/Have-you-been-relative-stupid</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/03/31/Have-you-been-relative-stupid</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771.full&#34;&gt;The importance of stupidity in scientific research&lt;/a&gt;&#34; by Martin A. Schwartz which I learned existed through &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hmason&#34;&gt;@hmason&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/simplystats&#34;&gt;@simplystats&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the point of how it&amp;#8217;s normal to feel stupid in academia and specially in Ph.D. programs to be illuminating. But Schwartz clarifies that there are other kinds of stupid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we don&amp;#8217;t do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid – that is, if we don&amp;#8217;t feel stupid it means we&amp;#8217;re not really trying. I&amp;#8217;m not talking about &#39;relative stupidity&amp;#8217;, in which the other students in the class actually read the material, think about it and ace the exam, whereas you don&amp;#8217;t. I&amp;#8217;m also not talking about bright people who might be working in areas that don&amp;#8217;t match their talents. Science involves confronting our `absolute stupidity&amp;#8217;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know about you, but I have certainly been &amp;#8216;relative stupid&amp;#8217; at times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, we have to confront our &amp;#8216;absolute stupidity&amp;#8217;. But to me, graduate school is also about learning how to be super efficient with your time. That implies being highly organized, learning how to canalize your distractions, and finding sources of constant motivation. For example, I now read more stats/R/research blogs as part of my set of distractions and have considerably decreased how many sport news I read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also struggle with the internal challenge of doing great at school, but then also &amp;#8216;having a life&amp;#8217;. So yes, at times I have been &amp;#8216;relative stupid&amp;#8217; but also had a great time. After all, I no longer need to &amp;#8216;ace&amp;#8217; all my exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Commenting scientific papers</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/03/11/Commenting-scientific-papers</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/03/11/Commenting-scientific-papers</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about commenting papers in blog posts. I did a &lt;a href=&#34;http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/tagged/Paper%20comments#.UT534NHF0W8&#34;&gt;few some long time ago&lt;/a&gt;, but now I&amp;#8217;m thinking of doing this activity more systematically. There are several reasons why I&amp;#8217;m thinking of doing this, say for 1 paper a week. It has the obvious advantage of forcing me to read a paper in depth per week. At the same time, I want to learn more from others. See what I like in other papers and maybe avoid some mistakes. There are two main lines of papers that I would be posting about. Anything that is somewhat close to my research (genomics, RNA-seq, biostatistics, bioconductor, visualization) and anything done by my undergrad peers from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t think that there is a compilation of papers from LCG students despite many of us doing research all over the globe —Mexico, US, Canada, Denmark, France, England, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Australia to name a few countries. Maybe compiling a list of papers with contributions from LCG students is a task for &lt;a href=&#34;http://masciencia.org/&#34;&gt;Más Ciencia por México&lt;/a&gt; which seeks to promote science in Mexico. But I would be happy to learn what others are doing and in a way keep in touch academically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason in favor is that blogging helps me practice my English. And writing helps me organize my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the question remains, if you systematically comment papers, what would you comment on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that I should state my opinion of the paper in different areas. Kind of like doing a review. First, try to summarize the paper. Next, was the scientific objective clear? They did answer the main question? Then, given the nature of my Ph.D. program, &lt;span&gt;I think that I should try to comment on any statistics used in the papers. This certainly includes the plots and reproducibility. If they included tools (software), I could take a quick look at it. Then, I can end with stating the main things I liked. Maybe I could come up with some scoring mechanism to rate the paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can think of other aspects to talk about of a paper. For example, in what way did it help it&amp;#8217;s field? But, I don&amp;#8217;t think that I can answer this for many papers outside my research area. It would all be speculation. I guess that I could use Google Scholar to see who cited the paper and maybe comment on it&amp;#8217;s impact that way. For the LCG papers, I could point out how the LCG students contributed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Or maybe I could take the more educational route. But that&amp;#8217;s very time consuming as I can see from &lt;a href=&#34;http://cienciaexplicada.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;La Ciencia explicada&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s highly detailed posts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyhow, if I have something clear in mind is how I would implement it. I&amp;#8217;m thinking of making a GitHub repository and writing my comments using Rmd and knitr. Then posting them here using Markdown. It should be easy to then have a template post and fill in the gaps after reading the paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The risk of using a template is that the comments will start to look boring. That&amp;#8217;s why I might add a more free section, or change things up a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have any ideas, let me know!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why aren&#39;t all of our graphs interactive?</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2012/10/08/Why-arent-all-of-our-graphs-interactive</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2012/10/08/Why-arent-all-of-our-graphs-interactive</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the last pre-happy hour seminar, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/&#34;&gt;Karl Broman&lt;/a&gt; talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/DynamicGraphs/&#34;&gt;Why aren&amp;#8217;t all of our graphs interactive?&lt;/a&gt; I didn&amp;#8217;t know, but a few years ago Karl worked in the department and clearly promoted beer-drinking and is &lt;em&gt;the heart of the department. &lt;/em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a fan of our pre-happy hour seminars since you have a get to listen to good/fun talks over a beer or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#8217;m also a fan of reproducible research and useful graphics. I do most of this by using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/&#34;&gt;Sweave&lt;/a&gt; (for reproducibility) in LaTeX documents and with the R packages &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html&#34;&gt;lattice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html&#34;&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotrix/index.html&#34;&gt;plotrix&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href=&#34;http://ggplot2.org/&#34;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt; (I should use it more). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl made &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/DynamicGraphs/&#34;&gt;his presentation&lt;/a&gt; using html (definitely check it out!) and inserted pretty interactive graphics. His talk got me really interested and I definitely need to pick up a few tools. For example, asciidoc or R Markdown can be useful for making html documents with R code. Specially if you want to write a report and you don&amp;#8217;t want to deal with Sweave/Latex when making plots (can be a pain to know where they&amp;#8217;ll show up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the interactive side, D3 (and other tools Karl listed) can be useful to learn. But I might put this on a hold for some time. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll wait and see what others in the deparment are developing for R-D3 and embedding interactive plots in pdf files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think that it will be long before interactive plots make it to the journals. Specially for their web versions. Though, I still think that if you are showing a 3D plot, as the author you will have to give a few default views where you can clearly see something that you want to talk about instead of having the reader find that sweet spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem that I don&amp;#8217;t think has been solved yet is reproducible research on a cluster. Karl and others mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html&#34;&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; as well as having if/else clauses where you either show the output or a cleaned up version of the code that you used to generate the output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are many tools and tips I can learn from Karl. And I&amp;#8217;m sure that I&amp;#8217;m not the only one! Hopefully he&amp;#8217;ll give tips on where to start (nothing is more tedious than reading UNIX man-files).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Online Bioinformatics Curriculum</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2012/10/07/an-online-bioinformatics-curriculum</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2012/10/07/an-online-bioinformatics-curriculum</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I talked about online courses in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/post/32688589475/jhsph-biostat-through-coursera#.UHH1Q_l26lo&#34;&gt;JHSPH-Biostat through Coursera&lt;/a&gt; post. Now I&amp;#8217;m back to comment on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002632&#34;&gt;An Online Bioinformatics Curriculum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by David B. Searls. &lt;a href=&#34;http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Dangl/people/individuals/Sur.html&#34;&gt;Sur Herrera&lt;/a&gt; pointed out this paper to me, and I have to say that if you are considering learning bioinformatics online it will be very useful to you. David Searls first goes through a history recap of online (free) courses. Notably, in the last year Coursera and other startups offered their first courses. MIT has also evolved and now offers &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitx.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;MITx&lt;/a&gt; courses, where MIT does give certificates. For example, I&amp;#8217;m a bit interested in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.00x/2012_Fall/about&#34;&gt;Introduction to Computer Science and Programming 6.00x&lt;/a&gt; course. It aims to cover a wide variety of topics which can be nice for a review/learning and is Python-based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main body of David Searls&amp;#8217; paper is a huge list of summaries for the main courses out there for bioinformaticians. He covers several tracks depending on what subarea of bioinformatics you are interested in. For each summary, he recommends an specific course to take along with the main reasons why he prefers it over other options. If you have ever looked into OCW, Coursera, etc; you know this is a great resource. After all, there are lots of options for some courses like calculus and it can be a time drain to look through them before deciding which to take. This summary is the best part of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Searls ends it with a conclusion section and some tips on how to make the best of the available resources. How far can free online education go? Well, obviously for informatics it can go almost all the way compared to wet lab biology. Plus, you have to be organized/dedicated/motivated and a good self-learner. Even with all that, you still need good ideas to use as learning projects. If you are looking for one, I would take a look &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/post/18493330661/statistics-project-ideas-for-students&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/post/32881133740/statistics-project-ideas-for-students-part-2&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where Jeff Leek lists some of his project suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning about social networks through an interactive presentation</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2012/09/28/learning-about-social-networks-through-an-interactive</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2012/09/28/learning-about-social-networks-through-an-interactive</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During this week&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~zhwu/2012journal.html&#34;&gt;journal club meeting&lt;/a&gt; Hilary Parker (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hiparker/&#34;&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://hilaryparker.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;) led the session on &amp;#8220;Identifying influential and susceptible members of social networks&amp;#8221;. Were there some speakers or why did she &amp;#8220;lead the session&amp;#8221;? By this I mean that Hilary tried a very different (and interesting) format this time. Instead of giving a talk, not a formal one like at seminars, she prepared a short presentation (publicly available &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wlZvL8z_8bOau2ZQkvxLtOuFwEVoTeOrJeQ9dO7vATs/edit#slide=id.p&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that begins showing a 20 minute video. This video is by the author of the paper where he presents the key points of his research at another conference. The goal of this format was to get us to speed and hopefully provoke enough discussion to make the meeting highly interactive. Plus the author does a great job in his presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, given that it&amp;#8217;s a biostat journal club, Hilary included some slides to explain the general Cox Proportional Hazard model before showing some of details used in the paper in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the change of format was a step in the right direction. Hopefully others will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;253&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/JmajkTKlEqw&#34; width=&#34;450&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the paper itself, the topic is interesting since it shows a different view of the &amp;#8220;data science&amp;#8221; vs biostat discussion. The presenter is trying to convince computer scientists that they need to do some statistics too. Over here, we are poking our heads at whether we need to learn some computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the author is in a different setting than academia or industry, which are commonly the two options. He is at NYU, and academic institution, but he is working closely with the industry (thus getting access to interesting data) and might be getting some consultation money along the way. Anyhow, given the recent talk from Amy Heineike on Quid (&lt;a href=&#34;http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/post/32472984157/quid-biostat-jhsph#.UGYOW_l27mY&#34;&gt;more in my previous post&lt;/a&gt;) there is a growing interest among students to learn more about the industry environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a couple of comments during the discussion, which might be completely wrong. One is that I feel that in academia we care much more about bias and removing sources of error and it seems that in industry that&amp;#8217;s not the main point. There you care more about making something useful which might be biased. You try to minimize it, but the judge are the clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one is that in industry options like getting a larger sample are much more feasible. In the video, at some point the author shows that people eventually joined the app after getting massively spammed. Increasing the exposure is easy in this case, but imagine a public health survey that is carried out door by door. Increasing the number of houses visited is way more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that the club meeting followed an interesting format, social networks seem fun to analyze, and industry vs academia is kind of a hot topic in our department right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Hilary for publicly sharing her journal club presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>P-values and Statistics phylosophy</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2012/01/30/P-values-and-Statistics-phylosophy</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2012/01/30/P-values-and-Statistics-phylosophy</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m in the process of catching up with all the posts from &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;SimplyStatistics&lt;/a&gt; that I didn&amp;#8217;t read during the break. Doing so I found a very interesting post on p-values (more below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;tumblr_blog&#34; href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/15402808730/p-values-and-hypothesis-testing-get-a-bad-rap-but-we&#34;&gt;simplystatistics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post written by Jeff Leek and Rafa Irizarry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value&#34;&gt;p-value&lt;/a&gt; is the most widely-known statistic. P-values are reported in a large majority of scientific publications that measure and report data. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher&#34;&gt;R.A. Fisher&lt;/a&gt; is widely credited with inventing the p-value. If he was cited every time a p-value was reported his paper would have, at the very least, 3 &lt;strong&gt;million&lt;/strong&gt; citations* - making it the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jbc.org/content/280/28/e25.full#&#34;&gt;most highly cited paper&lt;/a&gt; of all time. &lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/15402808730/p-values-and-hypothesis-testing-get-a-bad-rap-but-we&#34;&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like &lt;strong&gt;the p-value is a necessary evil&lt;/strong&gt;. The post is indeed a great read, but what caught my attention was the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;The advent of new measurement technology has shifted much of science from hypothesis driven to discovery driven making the existing multiple testing machinery useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m taking a class with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~crohde/personal/&#34;&gt;Chuck Rohde&lt;/a&gt; on probability with a strong philosophical component. That lead me to ask him recently how he would try to convince a biologist that he should believe/trust statistics. To explain myself a bit more, I asked the question as I&amp;#8217;ve been in environments where people follow their intuition on what is significant or not and disregard whatever statistics says on the same data. So in the past I&amp;#8217;ve been in discussion where I&amp;#8217;m the one trying to convince others that statistics say something is not significantly different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think that I communicated my question correctly as Rohde&amp;#8217;s answer is that whenever he says a +- on count data we (as statisticians) are not doing something right! He also reflected on the past as at some time people were quite into mathematical biology, a field that has either died out or transformed into new fields (systems biology comes to mind). Will the same happen to genomics? *Sound of a coin flipping in the air* I don&amp;#8217;t have a clue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, the post at &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;SimplyStatistics&lt;/a&gt; approaches the same issue I was trying to ask Rohde:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why not explain to our collaborator that the observation they thought was so convincing can easily happen by chance in a setting that is uninteresting. [&amp;#8230;] In general, we find p-value to be superior to our collaborators intuition of what patterns are statistically interesting and which ones are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end the post, I invite you to read the paper &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18692458&#34;&gt;A Brief History of the Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; by David Glass and Ned Hall from back in 2008. It&amp;#8217;s one of my all time favorites. I&amp;#8217;ve read it a few times and while my memory distorts what they really wrote, in my mind it&amp;#8217;s a great summary with a message: it&amp;#8217;s time to abandon hypothesis-driven science and continue with question-driven science involving building models from data and not from our hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few quotes from their paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;We propose that building hypotheses should be abandoned in favor of posing a straightforward question of a system and then receiving an answer, using that answer to model reality, and then testing the reproducibility and predictive power of the model, modifying it as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They end their paper with:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, although a hypothesis might have been thought to be necessary in the past, it no longer seems to be so. It is better to see science as a quest for good questions to try to answer, rather than a quest for bold hypotheses to try to refute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you agree?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/16347982080/why-statisticians-should-join-and-launch-startups&#34;&gt;Simply Statistics: Why statisticians should join and launch startups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really like this post in &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;SimplyStatistics&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://leekgroup.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;leekgroup&lt;/a&gt;. The topic is worth considering, but what got me hooked was the list of links to startups, which were all new to me. 100plus looks promising, though I don&amp;#8217;t have a clue as to what they are going to offer. Sure, I know the general topic, but not much beyond that. As I just flew back to town, Flightcaster and Hipmunk caught my attention. While Flightcaster works faster and has a great FAQ, I don&amp;#8217;t find it super useful since it&amp;#8217;s limited to US domestic flights, which are not the kind I usually jump into. Plus, without automatic updates it seems kind of a pain to use. After all, I don&amp;#8217;t want to become a panic-driven person who has to refresh the status of his flight every hour or maybe even every few minutes. Hipmunk on the other hand is slow, but I like their &amp;#8220;agony&amp;#8221; ranking :) It also looks easy to find cheap days to fly though I&amp;#8217;ll mostly cross-check with Expedia when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, to read more on the title subject check the original post at &lt;a class=&#34;tumblr_blog&#34; href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/16347982080/why-statisticians-should-join-and-launch-startups&#34;&gt;simplystatistics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;gt; The tough economic times we live in, and the potential for big paydays, have made &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;entrepreneurship cool&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/startup-america&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;venture capitalist-in-chief&lt;/a&gt;, to the javascript &lt;a href=&#34;http://chats-blog.com/2012/01/08/michael-bloomberg-learning-to-code/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;coding mayor of New York&lt;/a&gt;, everyone is on board. No surprise there, successful startups lead to job creation which can have a&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
