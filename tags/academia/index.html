 Research Technician Research Assistant Research Associate Staff Scientist I, II and III Research Scientist (+ Lead and Senior) Investigator (+ Lead and Senior)  Research Scientists carry out research, do so scholarly, are tasked with being creative, are encouraged to seek funding, and can have supervisory and mentor roles.

          Yesterday was an extremely exciting day for me and my colleagues. We finished a project we had been working on and shared it with the world. Meaning, it’s done and we can relax for a little bit while we wait for feedback from our peers.
But this was not any project, at least not for me. Why do you ask? In general terms, it involved an analysis that you could not search on Google and find the answer for.

          Origin of the idea Recently the team I work with has had a few new members and I’ve been thinking lately of ways we could try to help them. The team leader was traveling this week, which gave me the opportunity to come up with a new type of session and test it out. That’s the origin of this learning from our search history idea. We tested it today and I’m quite happy with the results so far, so I thought it would be useful to document what we did and share it with others.

          In the summer of 2008, nearly 12 years ago, I attended my first R/Bioconductor conference: BioC2008. Just last week I went to my second rstudio::conf(2020) which I greatly enjoyed. After some tweets exchanges today, I started reflecting on my journey and wanted to share my thoughts.
Why I like going to conferences I typically enjoy going to conferences, though I also end up exhausted.
  via GIPHY Part of it could be the traveling and all that goes with it, but I think that conferences are mostly mentally taxing.

          These past months I’ve been mostly working on one huge project which might be close to an end, hopefully! This project involves a massive manuscript with many supplementary figures and tables. Today we sent it out to other members in our team, and to celebrate, I’m now writing more 😅: though this is a blog post. I’m allowing myself to do so before I dive into the pile of tasks I haven’t completed1.

I’ll also introduce you to Aldo Barrientos (1987-2011) who was was my undergrad classmate.

          Today, September 19th 2018, Dan Rodricks (Twitter: DanRodricks) published an article in the Baltimore Sun. The article was shared to me with the title I only thought this happened to Mexicans1 and is currently titled2 as “Rodricks: Hopkins library specialist hit by immigration crackdown after being blindsided by visa denial”.
I didn’t like the title at all nor did I feel right when reading the article. I shared it with about 50 other Mexicans in Baltimore3, talked about it over dinner, discussed a bit with Hopkins colleagues, and now thanks to all of them I have a clearer idea of what my problems with this article are.

          Today was a big day. I care about many things including diversity in science (STEM) and building a community of R users and developers in Mexico. Both moved forward in two completely separate conferences: one in Mexico: CDSBMexico; and one in Canada: JSM2018.
CDSBMexico This was a very important day for me. It was the beginning of the Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018 in Cuernavaca, Mexico. I already wrote a blog post about why I was super excited about CDSBMexico, but briefly it’s because this is something we’ve been wanting to see become a reality for years and have been working towards it.
