      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many times I’ve started to write this post in my mind since May 2018. Today I’m finally typing it on the computer. This will be a rather long post that ties in several threads. I’ll talk about Cold Spring Harbor’s Biology of Genomes conference and its relationship to my undergrad in Mexico. I’ll also introduce you to Aldo Barrientos (198x-2011) who was was my undergrad classmate. Then I’ll tell you about myself and how regardless of your situation, privileged or not, you should ask for help and get to know the people around you. Finally, I want to highlight that many other Mexican researchers are doing great work and would love to be invited to talk about their work. Or simply, the opportunity to compete for scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;cshl-and-lcg-unam&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CSHL and LCG-UNAM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past May I was selected to give a talk at &lt;a href=&#34;http://meetings.cshl.edu/Genome18&#34;&gt;Biology of Genomes 2018&lt;/a&gt; (BOG) at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cshl.edu/&#34;&gt;Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (CSHL). This was my first time being there and I had plenty of time to reflect before my talk&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For me, attending BOG was like a dream come true so I was blown away when I was selected to present at BOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard about the BOG conference when I was studying my undergrad in Mexico at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/es/about&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;. My class has a history with the conference too. Basically, part of the class was meeting to discuss what optional courses to create for our fourth year, and well, some miscommunication happened among us. This created a rift in the group and was one of my motivations for focusing on communication as well as giving back. The former lead to me being elected as class president and the latter lead to me volunteering to teach R courses later on my undergrad&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As BOG18 went underway, some of my fellow junior presenters started their talks by mentioning why CSHL was special to them. Following their cue, I wrote some notes just before my presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/2018-11-06%2021.21.51.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to give a shoutout to all my LCG-UNAM classmates. I also thought of Aldo Barrientos and how it could have been him at BOG. This got me nervous, but I really wanted to do it. I also wanted this to be short and professional. You can see how it turned out for yourself&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRGkibDQgIc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;aldo-barrientos&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aldo Barrientos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time for me to tell you more about Aldo Barrientos, my LCG-UNAM classmate. I won’t attempt to tell you his whole story since I think that others could write a much more detailed one that myself. I hope they do and if they are made public, I’ll share them from this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldo came from a low income family in Mexico: I believe that his father was a farmer. He was smart and advanced through school successfully. He took the entry exam for LCG-UNAM like many people did in 2005. Eventually only around 10-15 percent of the applicants were admitted to this undergrad program. The school was free (25 Mexican cents per year), but it involved relocating to a new city. UNAM has some scholarship programs, but they are not enough. Aldo found a way like he always did. For example, he sold candy and juice to his classmates during lunch break. For reasons that I don’t remember, Aldo didn’t complete his undergrad in 2009 but was about to in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember Aldo as a very joyful person who was always smiling and joking with the rest of us. He had the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; dancing skills of anyone at my undergrad. He proved them time and time again, for example winning a dance contest at a party in my house and wearing the Pumas UNAM puma costume in our graduation party and dancing with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/goyo.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sk.pinterest.com/pin/170714642102216698/&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His path was cut abruptly in 2011. He was stabbed multiple times while waiting for someone. We all knew about this. It’s still unclear to me how everything happened in the following weeks. But I remember being told that he tried seeing a doctor before going back to his home. One day in 2011, we all started to learn about how grave his situation had turned. I didn’t know what to do&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I talked to David Romero, director (dean?) of CCG-UNAM back then. He guided me and others and we were trying to coordinate ways to help Aldo, but by the time we got to his home it was too late. I regret that we weren’t able to help Aldo earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have some emails from 2011 when we were talking about doing something to honour him. We never did as a class, though LCG-UNAM did acknowledge him. Maybe one day we will do an event to remember him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldo faced more challenges that myself and other classmates. Yet I believe that he would have kept solving them one by one; and had he chosen to stay in academia, then present his research findings at conferences like BOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;privileged-yes-entitled-no&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Privileged yes, entitled no&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about Aldo made reflect also on who has been around in my own path, who has helped me and how grateful I am to them. Undoubtedly I’ve had an easier path than others including Aldo. That is, I’ve been privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even with my privileged position it has been a hard fought battle to get to where I am now. I think that a mistake others do is that they assume that they are entitled to something given their privilege instead of working for that thing. This can apply to visas and the like where you still &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/19/problems-with-an-article-from-the-baltimore-sun-covering-dr-mahoney-steel-s-immigration-issues/&#34;&gt;have to apply for them in time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along my way I have hesitated many times what to do and have sought guidance from others. Also along my way, I’ve tried to get to know others in my surroundings. Now that I look back I realize that many people were at my position or in junior positions have kept working towards their career goals and advanced in them. So, if you can, get to know others and learn from them. They could be the future Full Professors with Tenure, future Senior Software Engineers or other titles you look up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an incomplete version of my timeline (&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/misc/timeline.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF version&lt;/a&gt;). I think that it’s pretty hard to list everyone who has helped you along the way. For example, I’m not mentioning my Ph.D. classmates from whom I learned many things. But it will give you a more detailed picture of the amount of people that have helped me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/timeline.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;invite-lcg-unam-alumni&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Invite LCG-UNAM alumni&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said at the beginning of my BOG18 talk, I’m not sure if I’m the first LCG-UNAM alumni to present at BOG but I know for sure that I won’t be the last one. That’s because I’m really proud of my classmates and all the great work they are doing. It’s also easy to go beyond my class to other LCG-UNAM alumni and then even go beyond and extend this to Mexican researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken from my timeline, here are a few that I mentioned there (links are to their Twitter profiles):&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What about a lawyer-like app as the minimum help for defendants in immigration cases?</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/17/what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/17/what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I attended the special panel discussion event at JHSPH called &lt;a href=&#34;http://hopkinshumanitarianhealth.org/news-events/events/separated-child-separation-at-the-border-a-health-and-human-rights-perspect&#34;&gt;“Separated: Children Separation at the Border A Health and Human Rights Perspective”&lt;/a&gt;. It got my mind racing and here’s an idea. It’s likely (definitely) incomplete, but maybe it’ll get others to think on related ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-17-what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases_files/ChildSepBorder.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://hopkinshumanitarianhealth.org/news-events/events/separated-child-separation-at-the-border-a-health-and-human-rights-perspect&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;panel-summary&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Panel summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel was composed by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ColleenKraft&#34;&gt;Colleen Kraft&lt;/a&gt;, President, American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EricSchwartzRI&#34;&gt;Eric Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;, President, Refugee International&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Escobar, Chief of Program and Services, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wearecasa.org/who-we-are/&#34;&gt;CASA de Maryland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pbspiegel&#34;&gt;Paul Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;, Director, Center for Humanitarian Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed the first 30 minutes or so but I still got to listen to most of it. The panel members presented many facts and here are some that will be relevant to the idea I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child separation is just one of the consequences of the current’s administration immigration policies implemented and enforced by the Department of Justice (ultimately headed by Jeff Sessions, the US Attorney General).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US is the only country (to the panel’s members knowledge) with a child separation policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to empathy many individuals across political lines reacted against child separation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US immigration system won’t really change much even if Democrats get elected. Obama did deport over 2 million individuals, though he prioritized &lt;em&gt;criminals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrested immigrants are not required by law to have representation (a lawyer) provided by the government&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minors (say 3 year old children) with no lawyers are being highlighted in the media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration cases where the defendants have lawyers drastically improve&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the odds for the defendants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges are human.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges typically used to (or maybe still do) try to give time for a minor to get a lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges are &lt;em&gt;alledgely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; being pressured to meet quotas in the range of 700 to 1,000 cases by year under the current administration. Thus judges sometimes have to close cases in a couple of hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges now basically have 2 options for closing a case: order deportation or (I’m missing the correct term) &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; the defendant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end the panel members highlighted that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; should take some type of action&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but that we should consider the consequences of our suggested policy changes. They also mentioned that we should take advantage of this moment (child separation got everyone’s attention) to raise the profile of the other problems with the current immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;my-way-of-taking-action-heres-an-idea&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My way of taking action: here’s an idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m by no means an immigration expert. My way of taking action is to share ideas, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2017/01/25/An-alternative-to-the-Mexico-US-wall-where-the-US-would-gain-millions-of-dollars/#.W6BV4v5Kg0o&#34;&gt;I’ve done in the past&lt;/a&gt;, that might be incomplete, unrealistic or even super flawed, but that hopefully motivate others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bare bones version of my idea was: what if immigrants could have an &lt;em&gt;automatic&lt;/em&gt; (programmed) lawyer and translator during their hearings? This would not be a replacement for actually having lawyers (say those provided by local governments or NGOs as George Escobar mentioned) but would raise the minimum bar for those immigrants who currently have their cases processed with no lawyers at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;getting-into-the-details&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting into the details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that we could get our hands on dozens/hundreds/thousands? of transcripts of immigration court hearings where we have the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the judge said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the government’s lawyer said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the defendant’s lawyer said (either to the judge or to the defendant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the defendant said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like a script for a play. We would additionally need a table with court hearing metadata such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome: deportation, being &lt;em&gt;freed&lt;/em&gt; (term?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date of the hearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State where the hearing occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then using machine learning (maybe with deep learning methods) process the text and try to determine potential suggestions an actual defendant’s lawyer would give to its defendant or respond to the judge/government’s lawyer. It might not always get things right, but I imagine that it would be better than the current state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automatic lawyer would need then to work as say a phone app that listens to what others are saying in the room. Say have 3 icons with one per person present (judge, defendant, gov’s lawyer). Then the defendant presses each button when each person is talking. The app then shows some 1 to say 3 suggested responses (with translations)&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and responds for the defendant in English once the defendant chooses an option (or goes with the top one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;implementing-an-initial-version-of-the-app&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implementing an initial version of the app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that large computing companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google would be willing to provide some compute credits on their clouds for the initial version of the algorithm that is &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to the court hearing and then provides suggestions. Think of this as the “suggested text” you get nowadays when typing emails on Gmail or text messages. Maybe these companies have programs where you can apply to have some of their engineers help you for a certain number of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that one big initial challenge would be to get that collection of transcripts from immigration court hearings where defendant lawyer(s) were present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that automated lawyers are not allowed currently in courts. But compared to providing human lawyers in all immigration cases, this change might be more &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; to pass as a law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that some phone companies might be willing to provide some refurbished phones that only have this app installed and are kept safe in the immigration courts. And well, satisfy any security requirements the government has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;improving-the-app&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improving the app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets say that you get that alpha version of the app working. If we had volunteer lawyers annotate the transcripts with some information about the intent behind what each person said (it could start with just 3 options: negative, positive, neutral from the perspective of the defendant) that could maybe help the algorithm that processes the transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we also had more detailed court hearing metadata such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location of the court (I imagine a that a few judges work in each court)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demographics of the defendants: like which country or even region of the country where they come from, whether the defendant has any family support, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Category information for the court hearing (maybe cases can be grouped into a few categories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I imagine that the app would be able to have more personalized experience, like re-adjust the suggestions based on which court you are located at and adapt the translations to the Spanish version the defendant is most familiar with (we say &lt;em&gt;buddy&lt;/em&gt; in so many different ways as shown below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-17-what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases_files/bromap.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pictoline/photos/a.1611821172410355.1073741828.1598399590419180/1623937737865365/?type=1&amp;amp;fref=nf&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app could also be connected to remote human immigration lawyers than can intervene remotely when the suggestions algorithm doensn’t know what to do. Maybe this could be part of some social service that immigration lawyers (regardless of their personal political preferences) could do as some elective during their formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;doing-some-convincing&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doing some convincing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that you could try to get support for this automatic immigration lawyer by arguing that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s better than no lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s cheaper than having lawyers for all cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves processing times on average (ideally) such that immigration judges can fulfill their quotas (here I’m hoping that it reduces the rate at which cases are closed with deportation orders).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is more humane than having a minor with no help. Though I hope that immigration judges would still try to give time for children to secure a lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might be implemented earlier (years earlier?) than changes in immigration law requiring that all defendants have a human lawyer in immigration cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If human lawyers can help through the app, then it also increases the number of jobs for immigration lawyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea has potentially many flaws because like any system, people on both sides will try to game it. This is where having a large set of transcripts would be useful as well as continuous updates to the algorithm such that gaming the system actually becomes hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this is just an idea, or a collection of them around one theme. It would need serious work to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Escobar mentioned that they protested the fact that a DUI labeled someone as a criminal, but well, Trump has gone beyond DUIs arrested many individuals with no criminal history.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Escobar highlighted that one path of action is to convince local governments to fund/provide lawyers to these individuals.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information has leaked about this but I guess that it’s not completely public info.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn6&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app could show the text but also should &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the translations since very young children will very likely not know how to read. I think that the app should never assume that the defendant knows how to read.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref6&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a big day. I care about many things including diversity in science (STEM) and building a community of R users and developers in Mexico. Both moved forward in two completely separate conferences: one in Mexico: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=jsm2018&#34;&gt;CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt;; and one in Canada: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=jsm2018&#34;&gt;JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;cdsbmexico&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CDSBMexico&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very important day for me. It was the beginning of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.comunidadbioinfo.org/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34;&gt;Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018&lt;/a&gt; in Cuernavaca, Mexico. I already wrote a blog post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/04/19/latin-american-r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/#.W1-lhNhKi50&#34;&gt;why I was super excited about CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt;, but briefly it’s because this is something we’ve been wanting to see become a reality for years and have been working towards it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Here are my slides for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CDSBMexico?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt; remote talk tomorrow for day 1 of the &amp;quot;Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018&amp;quot;. 70 slides for ~20 min, I can do this! 💪🏾 Right &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jtleek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@jtleek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Shannon_E_Ellis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@Shannon_E_Ellis&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/xKh2214YbM&#34;&gt;https://t.co/xKh2214YbM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/teaching?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#teaching&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Bioconductor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@Bioconductor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CDSBMexico?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/SULAoPbHeZ&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/SULAoPbHeZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Dr. Leonardo Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1023665229882961922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 29, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job was to give the first keynote to pump up everyone at the workshop. So I had a bit of trouble sleeping and woke up remembering a dream. If you know me, I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; dream: or never remember my dreams. It was a dream of my grandmother Mercedes Vides Tovar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-07-30-harrassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiraton-from-my-grandmother_files/2018-07-30%2018.15.38.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;grandma&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Grandma&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many things from my grandparents in me, like Juan’s joviality, Rosa’s love, Rolando’s tenacity to overcome tough moments. Or so I like to think. But my grandma, &lt;em&gt;Abue&lt;/em&gt;, has always been an academic inspiration. She overcame many challenges in her life. She studied at the university to become a doctor, even without total family support (to avoid details). She was a trailblazer in the field of Epidemiology. She had to flee her native country leaving everything behind. She studied at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pasteur.fr/en&#34;&gt;Institut Pasteur&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, France while caring for 3 adolescents as a single mom. She studied in a time when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=womeninstem&#34;&gt;WomenInSTEM&lt;/a&gt; had to disguise themselves up as men and were the targets of jokes all the time. Rolando, her classmate at the university, has told me a handful of these &lt;em&gt;jokes&lt;/em&gt;: I wouldn’t be the only one to call many of them harassment. She left academia to start her own business in public health. She was the main health supervisor in the first international conference my dad organized early in his career (which helped him launch it): I was the 6 year old in charge of delivering the gifts in the closing ceremony ^^. She would answer my phone calls when I first started French school and my dad was busy at work: thanks to their time in Paris my dad fell in love with the French way of teaching math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-07-30-harrassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiraton-from-my-grandmother_files/2018-07-30%2018.41.52.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually don’t know much more. She passed away when I was 13 after a years long battle with disease. Google tells me that she is a co-author of at least three titles in the field of Public Health:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1968 &lt;a href=&#34;http://saludpublica.mx/index.php/spm/article/download/3327/3212&#34;&gt;Organización del servicio social de los pasantes de Odontología en México&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1970 &lt;a href=&#34;http://saludpublica.mx/index.php/spm/article/viewFile/2346/2234&#34;&gt;Situación epidemiológica de la frontera norte de México y programa de vigilancia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1972 &lt;a href=&#34;http://saludpublica.mx/index.php/spm/article/download/1874/1822&#34;&gt;Proyecto de organización y funcionamiento de los laboratorios de salud pública en los estados de la frontera norte&lt;/a&gt;: also, she’s the sole author.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-07-30-harrassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiraton-from-my-grandmother_files/2018-07-30%2017.22.57.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did inherit her souvenirs from her trips (my dad also loves them) and something that is precious to me: a medal with her name. I’ve looked at that medal next to my bed in Mexico many times. I would look at it, search for inspiration, then try harder to solve whatever academic problem I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my dream there was a moment where I was sitting next to her (me in my current adult form) and we were revising many of our shared moments. She was explaining to me things she couldn’t explain before because I wouldn’t have understood them. She also pumped me up before my day and wished me luck for my talk. I think that I delivered ^^&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;womeninstem&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WomenInStem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a big day for &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=womeninstem&#34;&gt;WomenInSTEM&lt;/a&gt; and in particular in the field of Statistics. Why? Today the Joint Statistical Meetings (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=jsm2018&#34;&gt;JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;) held a session on “Addressing Sexual Misconduct in Statistics” that was organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/stephaniehicks&#34;&gt;Stephanie Hicks&lt;/a&gt; and chaired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/keegankorthauer&#34;&gt;Keegan Korthauer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;For &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;, I organized a session on Addressing Sexual Misconduct in Statistics. If you plan to attend the meeting, I invite you to join us &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/UxpUiqPzTy&#34;&gt;https://t.co/UxpUiqPzTy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/IdShEPlqi6&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IdShEPlqi6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Stephanie Hicks (@stephaniehicks) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/stephaniehicks/status/1004467110918213637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session is not a direct response (I think) but it’s definitely related to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KLdivergence&#34;&gt;Kristian Lum&lt;/a&gt;’s blog post titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kristianlum/statistics-we-have-a-problem-304638dc5de5&#34;&gt;Statistics, we have a problem&lt;/a&gt; and to the more general &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=metoo&#34;&gt;MeToo&lt;/a&gt; movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual harassment and misconduct not a US problem only. We have a code of conduct at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CDSBMexico&#34;&gt;CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt; both in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ComunidadBioInfo/R-BioConductor-Developers-Workshop-2018/blob/master/R-Bioconductor-2018_Program.rmd#code-of-conduct&#34;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.comunidadbioinfo.org/codigo-de-conducta/&#34;&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; to help prevent any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Q by me: what to do when people outside the U.S. say that this is an American problem and they don&amp;#39;t need to have a code of conduct for their meeting? &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Michael Hoffman (@michaelhoffman) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman/status/1024060403138142209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be there, but I wasn’t the only one excited following what has happening online thanks to tweets from many including &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mandyfmejia&#34;&gt;Mandy Mejia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman&#34;&gt;Michael Hoffman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. Now in CC-West Ballroom A. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#JSM2018&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/Pw9zdlhi02&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Pw9zdlhi02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mandy Mejia (@mandyfmejia) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mandyfmejia/status/1024042337033285632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;times-are-changing&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Times are changing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think that slowly, maybe sometimes quickly, the times are changing. I’ve been telling friends and family for a few years now that I’ve come to realize that we need to keep trying to improve, to stay updated, to do what’s best and maybe sometimes come up with new ideas to improve things. I do care quite a bit for &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=womeninstem&#34;&gt;WomenInSTEM&lt;/a&gt; but for me, it’s larger than that. It’s about diversity. I don’t know in how many different ways we can label each other and it’s not the point. So yes, gender diversity is a good thing and initiatives like this seem like a good thing to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Looks like a good thing to do. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/m2sjLYB1Er&#34;&gt;https://t.co/m2sjLYB1Er&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ashg18?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#ashg18&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/iKofjrIKTx&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/iKofjrIKTx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Dr. Leonardo Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1024068383564853248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I think immediately of next steps, like race and ethnicity as well as sexual diversity. I want to ask for more, but I sometimes hold myself back. I’m no expert on many of these topics, so maybe what seems like a good policy could easily backfire later. So I think about incremental steps. But maybe that’s too slow and not enough. Maybe careers are suffering but I guess that as a community we are going as safely and fast as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;This 💯! My career trajectory would have been completely different in absence of hostile environments. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/aqmQtVyXUW&#34;&gt;https://t.co/aqmQtVyXUW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dr. Elana J Fertig (@FertigLab) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FertigLab/status/1024044326664527875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not supporting whoever Michael was referencing in his next tweet. I don’t flirt at conferences: I do socialize and try to make new friends with fellow conference attendees. I do acknowledge that I struggle in my head with what is ok and not ok to do, particularly with people you spend at lot of time with at school, work, etc. I’m not certain of the boundary between clumsy dating skills and sexual misconduct in some scenarios. I think that I’m not the only one because I’ve heard different versions in different sexual harassment prevention sessions. So mostly I end up doing nothing yet sometimes I wonder if I lost out because I didn’t try a bit more with X person. For instance, Mercedes maried her classmate Rolando. What can I say, I’m still learning and we all probably need to learn to differentiate these boundaries better through more training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;We ran out of time so we didn&amp;#39;t get to hear the question from the dude who was saying that something (I presume flirting at conferences) was &amp;quot;human nature&amp;quot;. Our loss, I&amp;#39;m sure &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Michael Hoffman (@michaelhoffman) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman/status/1024066415752433664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know that sometimes I’ve been a bystander and failed to take action. So this next idea sounds good to me. I do try to intervene more now, specially with micro aggressions: because they are less high pressure situations and easier to do something about, at least that’s how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Bystander training might help. It&amp;#39;s not easy to do the right thing in a difficult situation when you have no idea what the right thing is, no training, no experience, no practice. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Michael Hoffman (@michaelhoffman) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman/status/1024063008987787264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
