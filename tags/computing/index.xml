      <title>me: Bad rm, don&#39;t delete stuff I didn&#39;t want to delete! (rm: well, I do what you tell me to do!)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Sandy was in town at some point I started doing some of my research work, but I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have. I basically did a silly mistake and erased files that take a long time to compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to being here, I had an alias in my bash profile like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alias rm=&amp;#8217;rm -i&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I setup my bash profile here I googled a bit to find what was the best common solution to avoid deleting stuff you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be deleting. That&amp;#8217;s when I found the following stackoverflow entry: &lt;a href=&#34;http://superuser.com/questions/384769/alias-rm-rm-i-considered-harmful&#34;&gt;`alias rm=“rm -i”` considered harmful?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the answers suggests using rmi instead of rm for the alias. The idea is that you will never expect that rm will run interactively in other machines, which could potentially be disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being &amp;#8220;smart&amp;#8221;, I set up my alias to be rmi. However, I started using rm (without expecting it to be interactive) and just ignored the alias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem is that I ran a more command with a pattern, saw that the files were empty, then deleted them with rm. Next, I wanted to check a different pattern, used the up arrow key and instead of editing the more command, I edited the rm command. When I noticed it, it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I only deleted some output files that I can recover. But it was a pretty basic mistake. And yes, the files were not backed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I will now stick to my rmi alias and hopefully avoid running into this kind of pitfall &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Online Bioinformatics Curriculum</title>

      <guid>/2012/10/07/an-online-bioinformatics-curriculum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I talked about online courses in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/post/32688589475/jhsph-biostat-through-coursera#.UHH1Q_l26lo&#34;&gt;JHSPH-Biostat through Coursera&lt;/a&gt; post. Now I&amp;#8217;m back to comment on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002632&#34;&gt;An Online Bioinformatics Curriculum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by David B. Searls. &lt;a href=&#34;http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Dangl/people/individuals/Sur.html&#34;&gt;Sur Herrera&lt;/a&gt; pointed out this paper to me, and I have to say that if you are considering learning bioinformatics online it will be very useful to you. David Searls first goes through a history recap of online (free) courses. Notably, in the last year Coursera and other startups offered their first courses. MIT has also evolved and now offers &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitx.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;MITx&lt;/a&gt; courses, where MIT does give certificates. For example, I&amp;#8217;m a bit interested in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.00x/2012_Fall/about&#34;&gt;Introduction to Computer Science and Programming 6.00x&lt;/a&gt; course. It aims to cover a wide variety of topics which can be nice for a review/learning and is Python-based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main body of David Searls&amp;#8217; paper is a huge list of summaries for the main courses out there for bioinformaticians. He covers several tracks depending on what subarea of bioinformatics you are interested in. For each summary, he recommends an specific course to take along with the main reasons why he prefers it over other options. If you have ever looked into OCW, Coursera, etc; you know this is a great resource. After all, there are lots of options for some courses like calculus and it can be a time drain to look through them before deciding which to take. This summary is the best part of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Searls ends it with a conclusion section and some tips on how to make the best of the available resources. How far can free online education go? Well, obviously for informatics it can go almost all the way compared to wet lab biology. Plus, you have to be organized/dedicated/motivated and a good self-learner. Even with all that, you still need good ideas to use as learning projects. If you are looking for one, I would take a look &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/post/18493330661/statistics-project-ideas-for-students&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/post/32881133740/statistics-project-ideas-for-students-part-2&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where Jeff Leek lists some of his project suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bps-occupational-digest.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-to-get-to-great-programming-skills.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ResearchBloggingAllEnglish+%28Research+Blogging+-+English+-+All+Topics%29&amp;amp;utm_content=Google+Reader&#34;&gt;What makes a great programmer?&lt;/a&gt; I would have said training, motivation, a good and efficient framework for continuous learning from others such as reading blogs like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-bloggers.com/&#34;&gt;R-bloggers&lt;/a&gt; (if you are an R programmer). Well, on the Occupational Digest blog they commented a paper where they found that the best predictor is programming knowledge. This is acquired through years of practice and makes sense. After all, even if you are a gifted person for something, if you don&amp;#8217;t practice and learn from others you won&amp;#8217;t get anywhere. So, welcome to school for life! :P&lt;/p&gt;
