      <description>When Sandy was in town at some point I started doing some of my research work, but I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have. I basically did a silly mistake and erased files that take a long time to compute.
Prior to being here, I had an alias in my bash profile like this:
alias rm=&amp;#8217;rm -i&amp;#8217;
But when I setup my bash profile here I googled a bit to find what was the best common solution to avoid deleting stuff you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be deleting.</description>

      <description>Last week I talked about online courses in my JHSPH-Biostat through Coursera post. Now I&amp;#8217;m back to comment on An Online Bioinformatics Curriculum by David B. Searls. Sur Herrera pointed out this paper to me, and I have to say that if you are considering learning bioinformatics online it will be very useful to you. David Searls first goes through a history recap of online (free) courses. Notably, in the last year Coursera and other startups offered their first courses.</description>

      <description>What makes a great programmer? I would have said training, motivation, a good and efficient framework for continuous learning from others such as reading blogs like R-bloggers (if you are an R programmer). Well, on the Occupational Digest blog they commented a paper where they found that the best predictor is programming knowledge. This is acquired through years of practice and makes sense. After all, even if you are a gifted person for something, if you don&amp;#8217;t practice and learn from others you won&amp;#8217;t get anywhere.</description>
