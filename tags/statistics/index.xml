      <description>Did you know that next year will be the International Year of Statistics? Well, you probably didn&amp;#8217;t! There is a site organizing the activities and listing the institutions that morally support the celebration. I&amp;#8217;m happy to see my current work place listed there but at the same time concerned that the National Autonomous University of Mexico is not in it.
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s not that surprising since there is no big Statistics department at UNAM.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m in the process of catching up with all the posts from SimplyStatistics that I didn&amp;#8217;t read during the break. Doing so I found a very interesting post on p-values (more below)
simplystatistics:
 This post written by Jeff Leek and Rafa Irizarry.
 The p-value is the most widely-known statistic. P-values are reported in a large majority of scientific publications that measure and report data. R.A. Fisher is widely credited with inventing the p-value.</description>
