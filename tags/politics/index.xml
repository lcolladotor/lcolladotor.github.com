      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, September 19th 2018, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com/balnews-dan-rodricks-20130507-staff.html&#34;&gt;Dan Rodricks&lt;/a&gt; (Twitter: &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/DanRodricks&#34;&gt;DanRodricks&lt;/a&gt;) published an article in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com&#34;&gt;Baltimore Sun&lt;/a&gt;. The article was shared to me with the title &lt;em&gt;I only thought this happened to Mexicans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is currently titled&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/dan-rodricks-blog/bs-md-rodricks-0919-story.html&#34;&gt;“Rodricks: Hopkins library specialist hit by immigration crackdown after being blindsided by visa denial”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-19-problems-with-an-article-from-the-baltimore-sun-covering-dr-mahoney-steel-s-immigration-issues_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-19%20at%2011.43.50%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like the title at all nor did I feel right when reading the article. I shared it with about 50 other Mexicans in Baltimore&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, talked about it over dinner, discussed a bit with Hopkins colleagues, and now thanks to all of them I have a clearer idea of what my problems with this article are. And there are many of them, but we can group them into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reporting by Dan Rodricks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; handling of Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s case by Johns Hopkins University,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; lack of attention by Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into all of it, there is a petition online in support of Dr. Mahoney-Steel that you can read and sign &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/johns-hopkins-university-support-dr-tamsyn-mahoney-steel-and-all-displaced-workers&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you want: nearly 2,000 people have already signed it. You can also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/johns-hopkins-university-support-dr-tamsyn-mahoney-steel-and-all-displaced-workers/c?source_location=petition_show&#34;&gt;read other’s reasons&lt;/a&gt; for signing the petition. Right now I do not feel comfortable signing this petition, but maybe you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-reporting-by-dan-rodricks&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The reporting by Dan Rodricks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article starts by framing Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s story around the fact that she had to return to England due to issues with her immigration paperwork and that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the reaction of several friends and colleagues was uncannily the same: “I thought this only happened to Mexicans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no need at all to grab attention to Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s story by mentioning Mexicans or any other Spanish-speaking immigrants. Dan Rodricks is trying to get the reader to think that &lt;em&gt;Mexicans are illegal immigrants&lt;/em&gt; (which many politicians have said), and thus that &lt;em&gt;they aren’t welcome&lt;/em&gt;, and then &lt;em&gt;ohh, others aren’t welcome either&lt;/em&gt;. Another interpretation of this quote is that &lt;em&gt;Mexicans are uneducated&lt;/em&gt;, which would be equally offending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m glad that the title has been changed at the Baltimore Sun’s website, the first paragraph and last paragraph of the story still mention this quote that is attributed to friends and colleagues of Dr. Mahoney-Steel. They might have said this, but Dan Rodricks could have simply ignored their quote and framed his story along the lines of the updated title: a library specialist that is suffering because of the current immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second problem with the reporting is that there is a lack of information that is important in this context. There are many ways to become a permanent resident in the US and thus get a &lt;em&gt;green card&lt;/em&gt;. Some of these ways involve getting sponsored by your employer. Some don’t. Basically, in some situations it would be the employer’s responsibility (Johns Hopkins University in this case) to be involved in and be supportive and in others I think that they are not obliged to help financially. You can have very different reactions to this story based on what mechanism Dr. Mahoney-Steel was asking Johns Hopkins University to help her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-portrayed-handling-of-dr.mahoney-steels-case-by-hopkins&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; handling of Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s case by Hopkins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; here because we currently don’t know Hopkins’ side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems to be the main reason why Dr. Mahoney-Steel’s case became a story is because she submitted her documents to request a renewal of her H-1B (highly specialized worker) visa to Johns Hopkins University’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://ois.jhu.edu/&#34;&gt;Office of International Services&lt;/a&gt;. She didn’t hear back from them until she heard in August 21st that they decided not to send her documents to the US government and that she should leave the country by August 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hugely disturbing and would be enough to grab the attention of many readers. This is what caught the attention of several colleagues at Hopkins. We haven’t really heard the story from OIS’ perspective and I would definitely want to know more&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of details in the article, we don’t know exactly which mechanism Dr. Mahoney-Steel was asking Hopkins to help her with. She might have been considering applying under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/employment-based&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;employed-based immigration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1&#34;&gt;EB-1&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2&#34;&gt;EB-2&lt;/a&gt;. For the EB-1 I think that your employer has to help you quite a bit. But not all employers want to do so. Also these processes take a considerable amount of time, not 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, maybe Dr. Mahoney-Steel was asking Hopkins to help her pay for her green card &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/immediate-relative-us-citizen&#34;&gt;application through family&lt;/a&gt; since she’s married to a US citizen and due to their &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; extremely poor communication on her H-1B visa renewal. I haven’t heard of any employer helping their employees with the green card fees in such cases. It’d be great if they did it, but I wouldn’t expect this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-portrayed-lack-of-attention-by-dr.mahoney-steel&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;em&gt;portrayed&lt;/em&gt; lack of attention by Dr. Mahoney-Steel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we don’t know how everything exactly happened. My issues here could be based on how Dan Rodricks used his notes from interviewing Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the Mexicans I shared the article with are not US citizens&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and thus have different types of visas that allow us to study and/or work in the US. We learn fast, either through personal experience or stories from others, that you have to prioritize any visa paperwork you have to do. That involves lots of planning and attention to detail. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing when your visa expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning the types of visas you can apply to after your current one expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fees associated with the different visa applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements for the visa you want to get: timeline, documents that you have, documents that you need to get, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating with all parties involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this information at hand you can make plans. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ois.jhu.edu/&#34;&gt;OIS&lt;/a&gt; is also pretty helpful, in my experience, as they provide seminars where they explain a lot of this information and you can also request to meet with one of their specialists. OIS also sends reminders that prompt you to get moving: get your documents ready and send them on time. Having defended OIS based on my experience I also have to say that I’ve heard them make costly mistakes that affected friends of mine. Ultimately, the immigrant is responsible for their own application and has to double check everything others make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I have learned myself that if something says that it can take between 60 and 90 days, that I should think that it’ll take 90 days and be happy if it takes less than that. This doesn’t mean that our plans are the best or that they always work out. It just means that we try to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, as portrayed, I’m surprised by Dr. Mahoney-Steel because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She didn’t contact OIS a few days after sending her documents to follow up on her case. If she had, maybe she would have had more time to convince them to actually send her H-1B visa renewal documents to the US government, ask for help for her green card (EB-1, EB-2?, EB-2 NIW?), ask for her direct employer (Sheridan Libraries) to intervene, etc. Still, OIS should have immediately notified her that they weren’t going to send her H-1B documents to the US government!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She has been married to a US citizen for less than two years (but over one)… and didn’t get a green card via an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/immediate-relative-us-citizen&#34;&gt;application through family&lt;/a&gt;. To my understanding, that’s one of the cheapest and fastest ways&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to apply for a green card. If you can get a green card, then you can stop worrying about visas. Isn’t that something we all want? Yes, it’s not free. The I-485&lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fee &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/i-485&#34;&gt;is 1,225 USD for someone aged 14 to 78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn8&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref8&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Say that you are applying via EB2-NIW and hiring some lawyers, then you are looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wegreened.com/Legal-Fees&#34;&gt;5,000 USD or more in lawyer fees alone plus another 700 USD for the government&lt;/a&gt;. Given the large advantages that you get from having a green card and her husband’s situation, I would hope that many would have helped Dr. Mahoney-Steel raise 1,225 USD. Luckily for Dr. Mahoney-Steel, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/family/family-us-citizens/bringing-spouses-live-united-states-permanent-residents&#34;&gt;she can still apply for a green card through family even if she is living outside the US&lt;/a&gt;. I would hope that Johns Hopkins would be willing to hire her back then, or maybe even now and have her work remotely from the UK while the green card application is being processed (if Hopkins has a branch in Europe).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does seem like Hopkins realized that they made a mistake (as portrayed in the article) because they covered her flight back to England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry to say this, but it ultimately looks to me that Dr. Mahoney-Steel felt entitled and never expected to face immigration problems. Though again, that’s the current lens I have, that is, Dan Rodricks’ article and the infamous quote from her friends and colleagues. That’s why it would be useful to hear more from Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;closing-remarks&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that Dan Rodricks and/or the Baltimore Sun edits his article to remove any mentions about Mexicans, which as they stand currently are all negative and ultimately offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hope that we get some clarification from Johns Hopkins University Office of International Services. Depending on what happened, they might have to apologize to Dr. Mahoney-Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an immigrant in the US, I encourage you to plan ahead as much as you can anything related to visa paperwork. The current administration will make it as hard as they can to legally immigrate to the US, read for example this article: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.propublica.org/article/authorities-can-now-deny-visa-and-green-card-applications-without-giving-applicants-a-chance-to-fix-errors&#34;&gt;“Authorities Can Now Deny Visa and Green Card Applications Without Giving Applicants a Chance to Fix Errors”&lt;/a&gt;. But you don’t need to make it harder on yourself by lack of planning. Take advantage of all the resources you have at your employer (OIS in this case) and ask your fellow immigrants to share their knowledge with you. Double check every document because others (like your employer) might have made mistakes in a form or letter (basically don’t trust experts will do their job perfectly) because the US government will make you pay (in time, lost opportunities, etc) if you make a mistake. If you are thinking about getting a green card, you can start by checking websites &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visapro.com/green-cards/&#34;&gt;like this one that lists all the possible ways to get one&lt;/a&gt; and by checking the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/eligibility-categories&#34;&gt;USCIS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ll write a letter to the Baltimore Sun including a link to this post. But that’s for tomorrow September 20th 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two friends thought of this quote by &lt;a href=&#34;https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/martin-niemoeller-first-they-came-for-the-socialists&#34;&gt;Martin Niemöller&lt;/a&gt; (which I didn’t know myself):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;acknowledgements&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank those who I discussed this article with and corrected some of my facts. If you want me to name you let me know and I’ll edit this post. I didn’t because going the other way around (from named to anonymous) is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw the article as a photo that was shared by Hopkins colleagues. Dan Rodrick’s Facebook page also shows the article with the original title.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 09/19/2018 at 10 pm ET.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us are students, alumni or even staff members at Hopkins and affiliated institutes (like myself).&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they ever can share their story due to privacy restrictions.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can be a dual citizen.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn6&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will still take months, say about 11 to 13 months from what I’ve heard.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref6&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn7&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The form you submit to get a green card.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref7&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn8&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might need to cover about another 400 USD in fees to get the documents that show that you have all the vaccines you need if you go to a place like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.passporthealthusa.com/locations/md/baltimore/162/&#34;&gt;Passport Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref8&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>What about a lawyer-like app as the minimum help for defendants in immigration cases?</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/17/what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/17/what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I attended the special panel discussion event at JHSPH called &lt;a href=&#34;http://hopkinshumanitarianhealth.org/news-events/events/separated-child-separation-at-the-border-a-health-and-human-rights-perspect&#34;&gt;“Separated: Children Separation at the Border A Health and Human Rights Perspective”&lt;/a&gt;. It got my mind racing and here’s an idea. It’s likely (definitely) incomplete, but maybe it’ll get others to think on related ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-17-what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases_files/ChildSepBorder.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://hopkinshumanitarianhealth.org/news-events/events/separated-child-separation-at-the-border-a-health-and-human-rights-perspect&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;panel-summary&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Panel summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel was composed by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ColleenKraft&#34;&gt;Colleen Kraft&lt;/a&gt;, President, American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EricSchwartzRI&#34;&gt;Eric Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;, President, Refugee International&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Escobar, Chief of Program and Services, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wearecasa.org/who-we-are/&#34;&gt;CASA de Maryland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pbspiegel&#34;&gt;Paul Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;, Director, Center for Humanitarian Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed the first 30 minutes or so but I still got to listen to most of it. The panel members presented many facts and here are some that will be relevant to the idea I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child separation is just one of the consequences of the current’s administration immigration policies implemented and enforced by the Department of Justice (ultimately headed by Jeff Sessions, the US Attorney General).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US is the only country (to the panel’s members knowledge) with a child separation policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to empathy many individuals across political lines reacted against child separation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US immigration system won’t really change much even if Democrats get elected. Obama did deport over 2 million individuals, though he prioritized &lt;em&gt;criminals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrested immigrants are not required by law to have representation (a lawyer) provided by the government&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minors (say 3 year old children) with no lawyers are being highlighted in the media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration cases where the defendants have lawyers drastically improve&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the odds for the defendants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges are human.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges typically used to (or maybe still do) try to give time for a minor to get a lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges are &lt;em&gt;alledgely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; being pressured to meet quotas in the range of 700 to 1,000 cases by year under the current administration. Thus judges sometimes have to close cases in a couple of hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges now basically have 2 options for closing a case: order deportation or (I’m missing the correct term) &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; the defendant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end the panel members highlighted that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; should take some type of action&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but that we should consider the consequences of our suggested policy changes. They also mentioned that we should take advantage of this moment (child separation got everyone’s attention) to raise the profile of the other problems with the current immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;my-way-of-taking-action-heres-an-idea&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My way of taking action: here’s an idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m by no means an immigration expert. My way of taking action is to share ideas, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2017/01/25/An-alternative-to-the-Mexico-US-wall-where-the-US-would-gain-millions-of-dollars/#.W6BV4v5Kg0o&#34;&gt;I’ve done in the past&lt;/a&gt;, that might be incomplete, unrealistic or even super flawed, but that hopefully motivate others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bare bones version of my idea was: what if immigrants could have an &lt;em&gt;automatic&lt;/em&gt; (programmed) lawyer and translator during their hearings? This would not be a replacement for actually having lawyers (say those provided by local governments or NGOs as George Escobar mentioned) but would raise the minimum bar for those immigrants who currently have their cases processed with no lawyers at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;getting-into-the-details&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting into the details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that we could get our hands on dozens/hundreds/thousands? of transcripts of immigration court hearings where we have the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the judge said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the government’s lawyer said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the defendant’s lawyer said (either to the judge or to the defendant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the defendant said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like a script for a play. We would additionally need a table with court hearing metadata such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome: deportation, being &lt;em&gt;freed&lt;/em&gt; (term?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date of the hearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State where the hearing occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then using machine learning (maybe with deep learning methods) process the text and try to determine potential suggestions an actual defendant’s lawyer would give to its defendant or respond to the judge/government’s lawyer. It might not always get things right, but I imagine that it would be better than the current state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automatic lawyer would need then to work as say a phone app that listens to what others are saying in the room. Say have 3 icons with one per person present (judge, defendant, gov’s lawyer). Then the defendant presses each button when each person is talking. The app then shows some 1 to say 3 suggested responses (with translations)&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and responds for the defendant in English once the defendant chooses an option (or goes with the top one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;implementing-an-initial-version-of-the-app&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implementing an initial version of the app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that large computing companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google would be willing to provide some compute credits on their clouds for the initial version of the algorithm that is &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to the court hearing and then provides suggestions. Think of this as the “suggested text” you get nowadays when typing emails on Gmail or text messages. Maybe these companies have programs where you can apply to have some of their engineers help you for a certain number of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that one big initial challenge would be to get that collection of transcripts from immigration court hearings where defendant lawyer(s) were present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that automated lawyers are not allowed currently in courts. But compared to providing human lawyers in all immigration cases, this change might be more &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; to pass as a law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that some phone companies might be willing to provide some refurbished phones that only have this app installed and are kept safe in the immigration courts. And well, satisfy any security requirements the government has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;improving-the-app&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improving the app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets say that you get that alpha version of the app working. If we had volunteer lawyers annotate the transcripts with some information about the intent behind what each person said (it could start with just 3 options: negative, positive, neutral from the perspective of the defendant) that could maybe help the algorithm that processes the transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we also had more detailed court hearing metadata such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location of the court (I imagine a that a few judges work in each court)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demographics of the defendants: like which country or even region of the country where they come from, whether the defendant has any family support, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Category information for the court hearing (maybe cases can be grouped into a few categories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I imagine that the app would be able to have more personalized experience, like re-adjust the suggestions based on which court you are located at and adapt the translations to the Spanish version the defendant is most familiar with (we say &lt;em&gt;buddy&lt;/em&gt; in so many different ways as shown below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-17-what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases_files/bromap.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pictoline/photos/a.1611821172410355.1073741828.1598399590419180/1623937737865365/?type=1&amp;amp;fref=nf&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app could also be connected to remote human immigration lawyers than can intervene remotely when the suggestions algorithm doensn’t know what to do. Maybe this could be part of some social service that immigration lawyers (regardless of their personal political preferences) could do as some elective during their formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;doing-some-convincing&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doing some convincing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that you could try to get support for this automatic immigration lawyer by arguing that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s better than no lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s cheaper than having lawyers for all cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves processing times on average (ideally) such that immigration judges can fulfill their quotas (here I’m hoping that it reduces the rate at which cases are closed with deportation orders).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is more humane than having a minor with no help. Though I hope that immigration judges would still try to give time for children to secure a lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might be implemented earlier (years earlier?) than changes in immigration law requiring that all defendants have a human lawyer in immigration cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If human lawyers can help through the app, then it also increases the number of jobs for immigration lawyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea has potentially many flaws because like any system, people on both sides will try to game it. This is where having a large set of transcripts would be useful as well as continuous updates to the algorithm such that gaming the system actually becomes hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this is just an idea, or a collection of them around one theme. It would need serious work to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr There is a 600 million to 2 billion USD annual market related to crossing the Mexico-US border. Allow temporary work visas (say 3 years) to take over this market and use the money to boost the US Border Patrol to build a wall of eyes, not a physical wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;President Trump of the United States of America,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cc President Peña Nieto of the United Mexican States&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Wednesday January 25th 2017, you are expected to announce your plans about building a wall between the United States and Mexico. I am opposed to building that wall but I also believe that providing alternatives is important when disagreeing. With that in mind, let me expose an alternative to your physical wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico has a net immigration rate of -1.7 migrants per 1,000 and a population of 123,166,749 individuals&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which means that about 209,000 people leave Mexico every year. The Department of Homeland Security 2014 report&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows that 350,177 out of 679,996 (51%) total aliens apprehended are from Mexico (52% reported elsewhere&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Many of the illegal immigrants pay people for helping them cross the Mexico-US border also known as &lt;em&gt;coyotes&lt;/em&gt;. Some informal surveys put the cost of a &lt;em&gt;coyote&lt;/em&gt; between 3,000 and 20,000 US dollars&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That means that there is an annual market worth about 627 to 1,050 million US dollars. This market exists and has been steady for years now. A physical wall in the Mexico-US border might not stop the illegal immigration to the US. Loss of jobs in Mexico directly related to your policies might even prompt more people to leave Mexico&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I believe that the high volume of people crossing the Mexico-US border makes it easier for drug cartels to hide and transport drugs. That is, it makes it harder for the US Border Patrol Agents to find who is transporting drugs and the track down the routes they use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what if the US took over this multi million dollar market? I have had the opportunity to visit countries that offer temporary work visas (ranging from 6 months to 3 years). The people interested in these visas have to pay a fee, pass a background check and sometimes go through health screenings. I believe that these immigrants pay the fee because it allows them to legally migrate, work for a while, save some money, and then go back to their home countries. From an immigrant&#39;s perspective, it must be very appealing to pay the same amount of money it cost to migrate safely and legally (for temporary work) than to attempt to cross the border illegally with the risk of dying in the process or getting kidnapped. Additionally, I think that temporary workers would feel much safer to go out of their homes while in the US, spending some of their hard earned money in the process and stimulating the local economy. They would be more likely to get a regular job where they would pay income taxes instead of getting payed &lt;em&gt;under the table&lt;/em&gt; and dodging the IRS. Furthermore, having the opportunity to legally go back home and visit family would be a huge advantage from an immigrant&#39;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing this letter I realized that the idea of &lt;em&gt;immigration tariffs&lt;/em&gt; is not new&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, I have not heard it being discussed recently and simply ask that you consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try to convince you that &lt;em&gt;immigration tariffs&lt;/em&gt; are an interesting alternative, consider what your government could do with an additional 600 to 1,000 million US dollars a year -- or multiply those numbers by two to get 1.2 to 2 billions USD a year by taking into account that about 50% of illegal immigrants are Mexicans. The average Border Patrol Agent self-reported salary is 80,250 USD a year&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The actual salaries range from 21,616 to 157,257 USD as of January 2017&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the &lt;em&gt;grade&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;level&lt;/em&gt; as well as other options&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In 2016, there were nearly 20,000 border patrol agents in the US&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That means that you could decide to increase the number of Border Patrol Agents by 10,000 (50%) for about 803 million USD or increase the number of Agents by 5,000 while increasing their salaries by 10% for about 602 million USD. Why do I bring up the number of Agents? Because that would mean that you are building a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;wall&lt;/em&gt; of eyes&lt;/strong&gt; in the Mexico-US border. I believe that under this scenario, you and your public relations team could convince your supporters that you delivered on your campaign promise of building a wall. It would just be a different kind of wall. The extra Border Patrol Agents and/or happier Agents (due to their increased salary) along with fewer attempts to cross the border (because immigrants would be interested in paying the &lt;em&gt;immigration tariff&lt;/em&gt;) would make them more efficient in their jobs. Some of them could be dedicated to making sure no one overstays their temporary work visa. Also note that by law, you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be a US citizen to become a Border Patrol Agent&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so you would be increasing US jobs by 5 to 10 thousand under this scenario. That is more than the 700 jobs you claim to have saved from moving to Mexico from the US by cancelling the plans to build a factory in Mexico&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I also imagine that this scenario would boost bus and airplane ticket sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of the opinion that &lt;em&gt;immigration tariffs&lt;/em&gt; would allow many individuals to have hope that they can improve their economic situation for them and their families. It would also translate &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; into a specific monetary goal. As of yesterday, 3,000 USD is about 64,000 MXN&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that translates to 800 days of minimum wage salary in Mexico&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Saving that amount of money would take over 2 years if the person didn&#39;t spend any of their income! While ideally the &lt;em&gt;immigration tariff&lt;/em&gt; would be lower than 3,000 USD, ultimately there would be a threshold that opens doors to more economic opportunity. So, Peña Nieto and Mexico have the challenge of showing that Mexicans can stay in Mexico and improve their economical situation if they can save that amount of money to start a small business, advance their education, among other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migration involves two sides and as presidents of two countries of &lt;em&gt;united states&lt;/em&gt; (American and Mexican, respectively) I encourage you to keep thinking how to &lt;em&gt;unitedly&lt;/em&gt; address migration and take over the multi million dollar market that &lt;em&gt;coyotes&lt;/em&gt; currently control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best,
Leonardo&lt;/p&gt;
