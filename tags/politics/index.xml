      <description>tl;dr There is a 600 million to 2 billion USD annual market related to crossing the Mexico-US border. Allow temporary work visas (say 3 years) to take over this market and use the money to boost the US Border Patrol to build a wall of eyes, not a physical wall.
 President Trump of the United States of America,
cc President Pe√±a Nieto of the United Mexican States
Today, Wednesday January 25th 2017, you are expected to announce your plans about building a wall between the United States and Mexico.</description>
