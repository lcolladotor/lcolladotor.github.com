      <description>John Bohannon wrote Scientists&amp;#8217; Photos Reveal Their Inner Mr. Spock which I found funny in a science-curious kind of way. I hadn&amp;#8217;t thought about the message you could be sending depending on which cheek you show. I had only noticed that people like to show more serious-looking photos of themselves and sometimes make it an obviously funny one. I have to say too that some of the pages from my co-workers don&amp;#8217;t even show a picture.</description>

      <description>Adam Ruben shares his answer to whether science is cool or not. Since &amp;#8220;cool&amp;#8221; depends on the current trends, this question is set on the recent landing of Curiosity. It&amp;#8217;s the landrover that recently landed on Mars and has been sending some pictures back. Anyhow, check his answer here. I liked this part:
 If the Mars landing draws students to science, it won’t be because they witnessed science doing something cool.</description>
