      <description>&lt;p&gt;John Bohannon wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/08/scientists-photos-reveal-their.html&#34;&gt;Scientists&amp;#8217; Photos Reveal Their Inner Mr. Spock&lt;/a&gt; which I found funny in a science-curious kind of way. I hadn&amp;#8217;t thought about the message you could be sending depending on which cheek you show. I had only noticed that people like to show more serious-looking photos of themselves and sometimes make it an obviously funny one. I have to say too that some of the pages from my co-workers don&amp;#8217;t even show a picture. I guess that&amp;#8217;s a more recent trend to make it more &amp;#8220;professional&amp;#8221; looking. Dunno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to guess that dead center-looking pictures are rare. At least when you look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/staff/index.php?id=RJ002&#34;&gt;Rachael Jack&amp;#8217;s one&lt;/a&gt; it stands out. It reminds me of passport pictures. For my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/index.html#.UD-xBmie5us&#34;&gt;new academic site&lt;/a&gt; I choose one that doesn&amp;#8217;t look serious, I wanted a fun one! Plus I make it obvious which country I&amp;#8217;m from ^^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason this doesn&amp;#8217;t surprise me:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;while English language and literature scholars showed the left cheek and engineers showed the right, psychologists were more difficult to categorize. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is science cool?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adam Ruben shares his answer to whether science is cool or not. Since &amp;#8220;cool&amp;#8221; depends on the current trends, this question is set on the recent landing of Curiosity. It&amp;#8217;s the landrover that recently landed on Mars and has been sending some pictures back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, check his answer &lt;a href=&#34;http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2012_08_24/caredit.a1200095&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I liked this part:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the Mars landing draws students to science, it won’t be because they witnessed science doing something cool. It’ll be because they witnessed science doing something human, something genuine, something legitimately appealing on its own merits. Something scientific.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
