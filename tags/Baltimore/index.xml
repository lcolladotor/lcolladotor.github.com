      <description>


&lt;p&gt;In the past months I’ve had a recurrent conversation with many people. This conversation is typically started with the question: why do you like living where you live? Some of them might be considering moving to the city I live in for work, some of them are thinking about leaving, some are happy here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, everyone is different and what makes some happy might not be for the rest. Some friends want to live in larger cities, others want different climates, others want to move in with their long distance relationship partners, etc. Back in 2015 I was finishing my Ph.D. and thinking about moving somewhere else in 2016. So I started to disengage from friends and the city itself. In the past couple of years, I’ve tried to change my attitude. Or well, adopt my parents’ attitude and follow their lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frequently compared my current city versus my home city. This comparison used to be skewed in favor of my home city: my current city didn’t have the tacos I loved, or the quesadillas at the market, or my family, childhood friends, etc. At some point I started to point out in my head what my current city has that my home city doesn’t have or isn’t as accessible. One of them is a large open, free and largely secure park where you can ride a bike or play tennis like Patterson Park. So I pushed myself to go biking and play tennis in 2018. I also found a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2019/02/03/the-power-of-tapping-into-your-community-for-support/#.XGOPnlxKiUk&#34;&gt;Mexican restaurant that feels like home&lt;/a&gt;. I made new friends that understood aspects of me that I didn’t show as much to others here, mostly due to cultural differences. And I started going more frequently to listen to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bsomusic.org/&#34;&gt;Baltimore Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; (BSO). So my advice for those who find their current city lacking versus their ideal city or hometown is to start looking for the activities that might be inaccessible elsewhere and that you enjoy. I really like the BSO, so I’ll get into more details about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;first-symphony&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First symphony&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy the BSO events and the story starts back in six grade in Madison, Wisconsin. That was my only year there and the school assigned me&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the chorus. That was new to me and I liked it quite a bit. At some point the chorus teacher offered some free tickets for a couple of students and their families to attend an event at a Madison symphony with a soprano solo. I don’t remember the name of the symphony nor the solo, but I was like, “sure, why not? Can I get the tickets?”. I knew that my family liked classical music and the teacher was happy that a student showed interest in the tickets. I had taken classical guitar lessons when I was younger because my dad loved it and we had several classical music CDs at home. I was blown away by the soprano solo despite my mom forcing me to dress up hehe. The second and last time the chorus teacher offered tickets, I was eager to get them, and we greatly enjoyed the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;classical-music-here-and-there&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Classical music here and there&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the years in Mexico, we would sometimes go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://musica.unam.mx/taquillas/sala-nezahualcoyotl/&#34;&gt;UNAM’s Sala Nezahualcóyotl&lt;/a&gt;. But it was always a bit of a trek: about 1.5 hr drive, early on the weekend, etc. It was maybe a bit too much and we would frequently get sleepy. I mostly listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planets&#34;&gt;The Planets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1812_Overture&#34;&gt;Overture 1812&lt;/a&gt; at home and particularly in family road trips. I remember one time crossing Aguascalientes where we had the volume super high during a portion where the symphony plays very low, and then boom, the symphony gets loud and my mom and brother were on the back of the car and complained quite a bit, but my dad and myself were really into it. So listening to the symphony reminds me about good times with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bso-during-grad-school&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BSO during grad school&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSO offers &lt;em&gt;student rush tickets&lt;/em&gt; for 10 USD the day of the event as well as a &lt;em&gt;BSO student passport&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is worth it if you go to 4 or more events in a season. Check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bsomusic.org/calendar/special-offers/&#34;&gt;discount programs&lt;/a&gt; for more information. Through a combination of both I went several times to the BSO in my 5 years of graduate studies. But most importantly, I went to the season finales which tend to be on the first week of June. The season finale in 2012 was just after my masters comprehensive exam, and the one in 2013 was also just after my Ph.D. comprehensive exam. Both exams were brutal to study for and the BSO season finales were an incredible release of tension and energy for me. I felt many emotions during both finales and loved them dearly (they also featured choruses!). Over the years I went to many events and there was even a season when several of my grad school friends and I got the BSO student passports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bso-since&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BSO since&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating, I got a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bsomusic.org/calendar/special-offers/&#34;&gt;BSO passport&lt;/a&gt; which is a great opportunity for those under 40 years old (nowadays it’s 99 USD) to attend as many events as you want in the season. I started to use the symphony as a way to work through my anxiety issues and mostly didn’t bother to invite friends. While that worked for me, in the 2018-2019 season I’ve been more proactive at inviting friends. I love it when a friend who hasn’t experienced the symphony much enjoys the show&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or simply a reason to get out of their house and enjoy Baltimore a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bso-opportunities-and-challenges&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BSO opportunities and challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, I’ve also been donating to the BSO. I’m never a high donor or anything like that, but I like to contribute a little bit. I’m thankful for the wealthy donors that keep the BSO discount programs running and that I’ve personally benefited so much from. If you think about it, not long ago listening to a symphony was something only those in court did. Today it’s true that you can notice many wealthy patrons. But there are also opportunities for those with limited resources to attend and enjoy this world-class symphony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also challenges. I’ve seen patrons complain about noises kids make: it’s hard to ask kids to stay quiet all the time. There are circumstances that magnify this: you can tell some kids have grown up surrounded by classical music while others haven’t. I think that a bit of tolerance can go a long way here to make sure newcomers feel welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenge that I think is very tricky is social media and phones. Many of my friends, myself included, like posting on social media. Taking videos and photos during most BSO events is strictly prohibited. I understand this from two reasons: first, the bright light of phones is disruptive&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and secondly, the symphony wants to try to motivate people to attend the shows in person. I either take photos before the show or at the very end&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s definitely a culture clash between what happens outside the symphony and what happens inside. We’ll see what time tells, but I do like that the BSO is trying to use Instagram more now. After all, social media in theory can help attract interest from others to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the BSO faces strong financial challenges which you can read about in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bsomusic.org/misc/bso-updates/&#34;&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; section. They are doing many things, including a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bsomusic.org/giving/bso-day-of-giving-2019/&#34;&gt;donation drive that ended yesterday&lt;/a&gt; for their anniversary. But as long as they continue their discount programs, this is a great opportunity that I encourage my friends to grab a hold on. It might even change your answer to the question: “do you like living in Baltimore?”, or well, play a role in it. It does play a role for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s me with some friends at a BSO event in December 2018. We didn’t know then, but the BSO president took our picture for us 😅
Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;This week the owner of my favorite Mexican restaurant in Baltimore, Rosalyn Vera, got death and arson&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; threats. I could have been a bystander, but I tapped into my network and asked for help and she has received it. It’s been great to see the power of the community in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-backstory&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The backstory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34;&gt;Bioconductor&lt;/a&gt; for work and I get to witness the warmth and mostly friendly &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; community where daily people ask for help and get it. Born from the R community is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org/&#34;&gt;RLadies&lt;/a&gt; organization that provides a platform for non-cis gendered males to share their knowledge and increase their visibility. In one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies-baltimore.github.io/&#34;&gt;RLadies Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; events, I met a Data Journalist from the Baltimore Sun, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/christinezhang&#34;&gt;Christine Zhang&lt;/a&gt; who gave an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_baltimore/blob/master/20181114_industry.md&#34;&gt;excellent talk&lt;/a&gt; on how she uses R for her job: for example, election maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, I’m Mexican. To get over &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/11/mindfulness/#.XFdVC1xKiUk&#34;&gt;my homesickness&lt;/a&gt; these past months I’ve been a frequent customer at a small Mexican restaurant in Baltimore called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cocinaluchadoras/&#34;&gt;Cocina Luchadoras&lt;/a&gt;. I also frequent live shows from a band called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/somebadhombres/&#34;&gt;Bad Hombres&lt;/a&gt; that plays covers of Spanish rock songs from the 80s and 90s, go to Latin karaoke nights organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/rootsraicesfest/&#34;&gt;Root Raíces&lt;/a&gt;, among other things that bring me joy&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;initial-threats-and-reactions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initial threats and reactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To warm up this week, I went to get some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=atole+de+arroz&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;atole de arroz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at Cocina Luchadoras twice. The second time was just about an hour after Rosalyn received death and arson threats on Thursday. I could tell that she was scared but she was also incredibly brave. The threats were because she has placed a sign on her restaurant to support the &lt;em&gt;Donald&lt;/em&gt; fundraising campaign from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ilegalmezcal.com/donald/&#34;&gt;Ilegal Mezcal&lt;/a&gt; that says “Donald, eres un pendejo” (Donald, you are stupid) . The person making the threats mentioned that immigrants are taking away jobs from US citizens. As a Hispanic customer, I got scared as well and became suspicious of whoever entered the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does one do? How would you react to a hate crime threat? Or well, any threat? Call the police. Do you comply with the request to take down the poster? Hire security? Close and move to a different location? I feel like situations like this put can you at odds between following your ideals and being pragmatic. In this case, Rosalyn had to decide whether to stand by her free speech rights or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States of America you expect that the police and the institutions that protect the law will help you. Unlike Guatemala in the 1960s when the police/military tried to silence/kill my grandfather due to the health clinic he and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/07/30/harassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiration-from-my-grandmother/#.XFdafFxKiUk&#34;&gt;my grandmother&lt;/a&gt; had where they would treat people from many backgrounds: he closed down, moved to Mexico, and had to be pragmatic and abandon some of his ideals. Or unlike Mexico in recent times, where there’s widespread insecurity due to the war on drugs, corruption, etc. For example, my father’s house was broken into, he got tied down and was punched until a few ribs broke: he called a Mexican military veteran for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here in the US, you call the police and wait for them to do their job. But you can also decide to ask for help from your community. So I offered Rosalyn my time and network, and she accepted. This was tricky as I told her, because I didn’t want to either give a platform for the person making the threats or to attract other people like him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Christine for help on whom to talk to at the Baltimore Sun, and she responded immediately. After some emails and knocking on a couple more doors, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-cocina-luchadoras-20190201-story.html&#34;&gt;Baltimore Sun published an article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LillianEReed&#34;&gt;Lillian E Reed&lt;/a&gt; with contributions by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_ThaliaJuarez&#34;&gt;Thalia Juarez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cdrentz&#34;&gt;Catherine Rentz&lt;/a&gt;. Catherine has published some great work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-two-years-of-hate-incidents-20180813-story.html&#34;&gt;hate crimes in Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and they’ve made an &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.baltimoresun.com/maryland-hate-crimes/&#34;&gt;interactive map&lt;/a&gt; to browse the data. From there, the word kept spreading and many started to show their support: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/ame4se/man_allegedly_threatened_to_kill_baltimore/&#34;&gt;Baltimore Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, local &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zeke_cohen/status/1091798436628832256&#34;&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt;, and many regular Cocina Luchadores customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-threats-continue&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The threats continue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went again on Saturday and the place was packed and things seemed to be trending on the right direction. The police had called and were supposed to meet with Rosalyn later. Instead, they didn’t show up and the person making the threats called again…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an allocation of limited resources, I understand that the Baltimore Police has many things to do and many people to keep safe. Catherine Rentz’ &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-two-years-of-hate-incidents-20180813-story.html&#34;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on hate crimes in Maryland from 2016 and 2017 highlights that this type of crime is likely underreported and that there are very few convictions. Maybe this went through the mind of the policeman who did the report on Thursday: “threat phone call? No witnesses? Ok, not enough evidence… move on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a very hard time processing the no-show by the police though. Talking to others, we discussed how the law enforcement system is overworked (they are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wmar2news.com/homepage-showcase/baltimore-police-to-switch-to-new-patrol-schedule&#34;&gt;reducing the police officer shift length&lt;/a&gt; soon) and swamped. But hey, there’s a supportive community. So I asked for help again. “Who knows someone at the Baltimore Police?” That was the question and soon enough one friend replied, and then emailed a lieutenant. By the next morning (Sunday/today), the Baltimore Police chief was looking to call Rosalyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we let the Baltimore Sun know that the person had made the threat again. They quickly posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-threat-over-anti-trump-poster-spurs-business-20190202-story.html&#34;&gt;new story&lt;/a&gt; where they report how Rosalyn first made sure to secure more witnesses this time and secondly told the person making the threats that she has only love for him and thanked him for the phone call. I think that she was really smart with both and she does mean it. In a chat with friends, one of them suggested bringing tacos as a peace offering to the person making the threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second story by the Baltimore Sun got shared by Newsweek in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newsweek.com/restaurant-owner-allegedly-receives-death-threats-over-anti-trump-banner-1315971&#34;&gt;own story&lt;/a&gt;. A friend who is in Mexico right now told me he saw it on the top Apple News stories. Today, there was a security guard at Cocina Luchadoras, who smiled and opened the door for anyone coming in. So spreading the word, asking for help, knocking on doors, and the power of the community is very strong. Strong enough to get the police to pay more attention to Rosalyn’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is incredible! Typically, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RLadies&#34;&gt;#RLadies&lt;/a&gt; request for help ends up with a friendly reply pointing to an existing R package or a suggestion on what to do. This time, we gamed the system. So yes, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/11/12/asking-for-help-is-challenging-but-is-typically-worth-it/#.XFdT41xKiUk&#34;&gt;asking for help is challenging but can be worth it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And surely everyone who’s involved in helping in this story can use it to request the help they need. For example, the Baltimore Sun’s hate crime reporting team can ask for more space and resources for their stories. Or the Baltimore and Maryland Police can ask for help from whoever controls their budget&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so they can get more resources to fight the increase in hate crimes, improve the reporting of hate crime threats, and reach out ot the Hispanic community in Baltimore. If they need a letter of support, they can get one from me if they want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, it’s a chance to try to live without fear. Fear is a powerful feeling and I’ve seen it in action. I experienced it first hand when everyone I knew stopped going out in Cuernavaca during an intense period of the war on drugs when military were deployed to the streets. It’s also a chance for us Hispanics in Baltimore to feel like we belong here, which is the same challenge many women and non-cis males have and hence the reason why &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org/&#34;&gt;RLadies&lt;/a&gt; is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;and-drop-by-to-enjoy-the-awesome-food-and-women-art&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;And drop by to enjoy the awesome food and women art!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you drop by in Baltimore, you should go visit Cocina Luchadoras! Their food is deliciously awesome. It starts with handmade tortillas. You use tortillas for many things including tacos. A good tortilla can boost the flavor in a taco, and the ones at Cocina Luchadoras are outstanding! Then there’s the filling which can range from pork (&lt;em&gt;al pastor&lt;/em&gt;) to different types of vegetables. And while you wait, you get to experience a women’s empowerment museum with all the arts and crafts they have there about how women are really strong! You also get to meet many interesting patrons and make new friends if you wish to do so. Even if you are not in Baltimore, you should follow them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cocinaluchadoras/&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/cocinaluchadoras/&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for great art and food pictures (or &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobile.twitter.com/cocinaluchadora&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but they don’t post images there, just links to Instagram).&lt;/p&gt;
