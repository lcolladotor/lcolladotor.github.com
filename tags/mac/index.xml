      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the semester, I decided to go hunting for Mac apps that would help me be more organizing and/or enjoy my Mac even more. After all, I was using the basics –with multiple spaces– and had only customized my favorite editors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/12w0M6m&#34;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent app. The free version can get you a lot of mileage and save you lots of time by typing alt + space, then entering  the keyword you want to search in Google. Or alt + space, image, then the  query for Google Images. Or alt + space, find, the parts of the name of a file you want. Or alt + space, in, something you want to find inside a file. I love the alt + space, define, something I want to find in the dictionary. I know that dictionaries are just around the corner [a bookmark away!] but still, thanks to Alfred I now look up words WAY more frequently than what I did before. I mean, just not having to move my hands away from my keyboard and doing a ton of stuff is just great =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other default searches that come with Alfred&amp;#8217;s free version. Another thing that I love is using it to do system commands like lock the screen, or send my computer to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out!&lt;/p&gt;
