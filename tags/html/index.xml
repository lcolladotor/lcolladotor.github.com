      <description>As a biostatistics student, I use R very frequently when analyzing data. At the same time, I interact with other researchers, some who know how to use R (R crowd) and some who don&#39;t (yet!): no-R crowd. This means that I have to be able to communicate my results to two crowds. It is important that I can quickly provide the code in case that the R savvy want to look at it: maybe they find a bug and report it ^^.</description>

      <description>I got a question today on how to add a video to a beamer pdf presentation. Well, I had never done it, but I got curious enough to google around for a bit and here is the end product.
One way of doing it is using the media9 tex package. For this to work you need to have the latest version of texlive (or miktex). Then, it&amp;#8217;s quite straight forward to include the video.</description>
