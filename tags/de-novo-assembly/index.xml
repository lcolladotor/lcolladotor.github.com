      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been recently impressed by Steven Salzberg talk as you might have noticed, and browing his home page I stumbled upon his opinion piece (also by James Yorke): Beware of mis-assembled genomes.
It&amp;#8217;s a short note published in 2005, but damn, can anyone deny that it fits perfectly for today&amp;#8217;s state of the art in the de novo genome assembly field? I bet no one will. For instance, it&amp;#8217;s a solid statement to say:</description>

      <description>During this week&amp;#8217;s Genomics seminar at the Genome Cafe in the Biostats department, Steven Salzberg gave a talk on his team new published paper: GAGE: A critical evaluation of genome assemblies and assembly algorithms. I worked on a few assembly projects during my time at Winter Genomics, but that was not the main reason why I was immediately submerged into his talk. I think that it was due to his bold comments since comparing genome assemblers is a, hmm&amp;#8230;, delicate issue.</description>
