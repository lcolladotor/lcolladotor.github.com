      <description>When Sandy was in town at some point I started doing some of my research work, but I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have. I basically did a silly mistake and erased files that take a long time to compute.
Prior to being here, I had an alias in my bash profile like this:
alias rm=&amp;#8217;rm -i&amp;#8217;
But when I setup my bash profile here I googled a bit to find what was the best common solution to avoid deleting stuff you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be deleting.</description>
