      <title>Mindfulness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently participated for the first time in a silent retreat (6 hrs) as part of a &lt;em&gt;Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction&lt;/em&gt; course. Iâ€™ve really been enjoying this course and the experience of learning new ways (for me) to live better and enjoy life more. If you havenâ€™t heard of &lt;em&gt;mindfulness&lt;/em&gt; before (like me a few months ago), &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; defines it as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one&amp;#39;s attention to
experiences occurring in the present moment, which can be developed
through the practice of meditation and other training.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In academia and science, but really anywhere, we can encounter many sources of stress (some examples below). We all deal with it in different ways and this MBSR course is just one that Iâ€™m liking right now and recommend. If thereâ€™s no course near you, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C4BA3UK&#34;&gt;Full Catastrophe Living&lt;/a&gt; book that my course is based on&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these tweets are threads, so youâ€™ll have to open them to see them: click on the blue bird on the right side of each tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Thanks for sharing this Ted! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tladeras?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@tladeras&lt;/a&gt; As with anything, but particularly with mental health, I think itâ€™s important to know you are not alone and that some things we feel have names: impostor syndrome, anxiety, depression, etc. Our minds are very powerful! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MentalHealthMatters?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#MentalHealthMatters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/X1UIAznV8f&#34;&gt;https://t.co/X1UIAznV8f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; L. Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1004478330257707008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the exercises on our silent retreat was &lt;em&gt;mindful eating&lt;/em&gt;. That is, eating slowly and focusing on our senses while eating food. This involved smelling the food, seeing all the colors it has, feeling all the different textures, and focusing on its taste. Plus, not talking to anyone. I had bought a lunch before the retreat (so I wouldnâ€™t have to break the silence during it) that I normally donâ€™t find interesting: some fruit and a chicken curry wrap from CVS. But wow, it was amazing that day! I greatly enjoyed how it tasted and all the different sensations I felt. I couldnâ€™t believe it was the same food I had eaten other times before without much excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately Iâ€™ve been processing some strong feelings related to feeling unwelcome, homesickness and loneliness. Iâ€™m doing many things that I know help me, starting with talking about them with my family. Iâ€™ve also been keeping myself busy doing some sports outside, going to events, bars, having friends over, etc. But what motivated me to write this post today is that after lunch I left really bad today. I had to go outside and try to calm myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-06-11-mindfulness_files/2018-06-11_13.25.34.jpg&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I did, returned to work, and nah, I couldnâ€™t do it today. So I went home, rested in my room in the dark, and I find myself finishing this post about 2 hours later. Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s related to the MSBR course, but Iâ€™m wondering if the mindfulness practice is also opening my mindâ€™s ears and eyes to my inner feelings way more than normal&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s bad. Itâ€™s just that itâ€™s way harder to enjoy this process than it was eating a lunch. Iâ€™m trying to feel happy because I have feelings and Iâ€™m recognizing them. My family is also happy because they view it as a part of maturing and that Iâ€™m getting ready for taking another step in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just some things are taking me way more time than normal. For example, it took me 2 days to process what I wanted to reply to a tweet and how to word it: it turned out well because I think we all heard each other ^^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Thanks for the link &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@apreshill&lt;/a&gt;! I agree that the blog post was aweful! You canâ€™t blame X for the fact that X is marginalized. However, I disagree with the notion that Z canâ€™t talk about X (challenging). Iâ€™m in favor of inclusion. Otherwise that line of thought leads to xenophobia&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; L. Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/1006207918813958145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also discovered that the silent retreat reminded me of vacations where I turn off my phone/email and spend a few days thinking about whatâ€™s next. I used to go to Mexico every 6 months or so during my PhD to recharge. I want to do it again, but I canâ€™t. That lead me to my strong feelings of homesickness I had today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to close, Iâ€™m OK. I appreciate all the support I have and I recommend others to learn about mindfulness. You might be missing out some super tasty lunches and/or an exploration trip towards your inner self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to add that I know some of you might see this post as over-sharing (yes, it might be). One reply is that I think that leaders also have to show their vulnerable sides. This has been debated a lot in academic twitter accounts in the context of showing your failures too, not just your successes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What does it take to be a good leader?</title>
      <link>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/06/12/What-does-it-take-to-be-a-good-leader/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/06/12/What-does-it-take-to-be-a-good-leader/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leader: scientific or project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind before trying to answer this question I have to define &lt;strong&gt;leader&lt;/strong&gt;. Right now I have two â€”possibly conflictingâ€” leaders in mind. One is a scientific leader in the sense of a leader in a specific scientific discipline. The other is a leader who can organize and lead projects, either scientific ones (across labs for example) or what I want to call revolutionary projects. With such a grandiose name I am trying to cover the type of projects that can help change a country. However, in reality this second type of leader is closer to administrative roles in leading academic institutions, like the chair of a department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good leader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do we say that a &lt;em&gt;leader&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;good leader&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the project leader (second type), I believe that the key is that a good leader gets the job done. The job might have some flaws, but this type of leader can lead a team to produce results. The next aspect you might want to request from a good leader is that they get the job done efficiently (time, resources). However, I would argue that another important characteristic is reducing (minimizing if we were to consider it a mathematical function) internal tensions (frictions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the scientific leader, I struggle more to define it. Is a good scientific leader someone that produces good ideas and publishes them in a timely manner? Is it measured by their ability to secure research funds? Or is it that during their lifetime they had one brilliant idea that changed a field? Or is it just a measure of the number of citations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common aspects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that one of the most important skills both types of leaders should have is the ability to write clearly. If you cannot write clearly, then you cannot communicate your ideas properly. Without communicating your ideas, you cannot convince anyone that your research work is interesting or that your project is going to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I think that the ability to listen to others and synthesize their ideas is important for both types of leaders. If you cannot listen to others, you will be left alone pretty soon. But you cannot be involved in meetings all day long, so being able to quickly understand and keep the key points others are telling you (what I called synthesize) will be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that another important trait is being able to manage some important details secretly but still being able to discuss them with others at some level where you get useful feedback. Said in a different way, you want to test if your idea sounds good but you don&amp;#8217;t want to spill the beans and let everyone jump on it before you are ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diverging aspects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I strongly believe that frequent communication helps reduce the internal frictions. You have to tell what is the next step in the plan, keep everyone involved, but you also have to listen to what others are telling you. While I think that frequent communication helps a lot in a lab environment or when leading a project, again I am not sure that it is something a good scientific leader has. But I know that it is something I aspire to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then wonder if good oral communication skills are required for good leaders. I think that the answer is a definite yes for good scientific leaders, who after all frequently expose their work at conferences. But a project leader might not need such type of skill. Sure, they give speeches here and there but probably talk less in front of audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am certainly separating the ability to talk one-on-one or one-to-a-small-group (like in a table) from good oral communication skills. For me the latter are related to talking in front of audiences while the former are strongly based on the person&amp;#8217;s social skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to become a good leader?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is really the question that I am currently asking myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For writing, I think that practicing is very important. That is one of the key reasons why I like to blog and do so in English. As for listening to others, well, I am not sure how to proceed. The secrecy aspect of things is certainly one of my weakest points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequent communication is something that I think I am decent at doing and the key for me is good email managing skills. I am obviously practicing by trying to write shorter (more concise) emails and keeping my inbox as empty as possible following most of the tips given on &lt;a href=&#34;http://xph.us/2013/01/22/inbox-zero-for-life.html&#34;&gt;Inbox Zero for Life&lt;/a&gt; by Keith Rarick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overall, I wonder if I should take some courses beyond my scientific discipline of interest if I want to be a good leader. Writing? Maybe. I tried a Coursera course and failed to keep up during the comprehensive exam study season. Some kind of managing projects class? Hmâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you also need to learn to be patient to be a good leader? After all, my motivation takes a big hit when I have to deal with people I would rather not. I am also not so patient with those that complain without proposing alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess that I am at the stage where I am seeking all the feedback I can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
