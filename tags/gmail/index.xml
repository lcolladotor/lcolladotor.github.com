      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using the &amp;#8220;Inbox Zero for Life&#34; strategy for a few weeks, and I think that it&amp;#8217;s been payed off for me in this short span.
As it&amp;#8217;s stated in that long guide, one of the major concerns you might have is that it could end up as just changing a current problem for another one. I think that so far, that hasn&amp;#8217;t been the case for me. Sure, my starred emails is not 0, but it stays at a steady number and doesn&amp;#8217;t increase as my inbox (even with priority inbox) did.</description>

      <description>Do you use Gmail as your primary email account? Primary, what? Well, I&amp;#8217;m sure that you have your personal account somewhere and your work or university account too. You can either log into each email interface or you can integrate them to a single one.
Gmail makes this easy as you can go to the &amp;#8220;Settings -&amp;gt; Accounts and Import&amp;#8221; to set up Gmail to pull all of your email into it.</description>
