      <description>&amp;#8220;Do analytics really tell the whole story?&#34; by Vic Ketchman explores how analytics is used nowadays in the NFL draft. The entry point is the &#34;Moneyball&#34; movie and Ketchman&amp;#8217;s piece is mainly a digested interview to Tony Villiotti from draftmetrics.com
According to him:
 What is analytics? Itâ€™s the accumulation of meaningful patterns in data, for the purpose of using that data to predict future results.
 I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of the wording used, but well, the point they make is that they use data to predict the future.</description>

      <description>It was great to have a little break, Spring break, although the weather didn&amp;#8217;t feel like spring at all! During the early part of the break I worked on my final project for Jeff Leek&amp;#8217;s data analysis class, which we call 140.753 here. Continuing my previous posts on the topic, this time I&amp;#8217;ll share the results of my final project.
At the beginning of the course, we had to submit a project plan (more like a proposal) and in mine I announced my interest to look into some sports data.</description>
