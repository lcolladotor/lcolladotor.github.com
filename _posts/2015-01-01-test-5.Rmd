# This is an R Markdown document. 
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 
## For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```  

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r boilerplate sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```
