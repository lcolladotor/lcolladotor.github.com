      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2023/04/16/czi-lat-am-meeting-2023-some-questions-i-have-before-the-meeting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited for the opportunity to participate at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CZILatAmMtg&amp;amp;src=typed_query&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#CZILatAmMtg&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cziscience&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CZI Science&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m also thankful to those who nominated me, and in particular to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AleMedinaRivera&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alejandra Medina Rivera&lt;/a&gt;. I believe that one of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;m here is for my volunteer work at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico (CDSB), where &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/#people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; have made very important contributions. Some also know me from my time in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bioconductor Community Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt;, from which I stepped down earlier this year once my term ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I have been sharing with some other event attendees that I do feel burned out. I had envisioned that at CDSB we would train and empower those who would eventually replace us. And we&amp;rsquo;ve had quite a bit of success in doing so (3/7 CDSB board members are not founders). However, it&amp;rsquo;s been limited to a few key new volunteers, who then they risk burning out themselves. Since I want CDSB to continue on for many more years to come, I sometimes feel like I should again involve myself on organizing CDSB events. Doing so would involve volunteering on my free time. Given my position as a principal investigator, I actually spend more extra hours on activities related to that job, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much free time to give. There are also other non-academic interests I want to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I want to chat with others that organize short courses through their own organizations to learn how they plan to pass on the torch and see if those ideas can apply to CDSB as well as renew my own fire. Maybe others don&amp;rsquo;t plan to pass on the torch for many years as organizing these short courses becomes part of their main job. At CDSB (and LCG-UNAM) courses, I like the path of having students in year 1, that become teaching assistants in year 2, that then teach a portion of the course in year 3, then can organize part of or a full course in year 4. But that&amp;rsquo;s a long ramp, and I think that I failed to anticipate what would happen after year 4. Like there needs to be more structure to help them continue this cycle and reach a point where they can apply for grants without the names of the founders. I also failed to notice that founders would need to be involved for a longer period of time, until we reach a larger critical mass of highly trained volunteers, which at time point can fully replace us and keep CDSB going for more years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I also have other questions and topics I want to discuss with others. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m really curious to learn about justifications others use to convince their employers to let them spend work time on these type of initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some arguments I&amp;rsquo;ve used are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are training the future staff we want to recruit. I learned this from a former &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sacnas.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SACNAS&lt;/a&gt; president and it was useful to argue for time to teach (in my case in Mexico) without having to take vacations time to do so for a week or two per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is one I used recently in the context of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LIBD rstats club&lt;/a&gt; I organize at work: &amp;ldquo;YouTube analytics tell me that we&amp;rsquo;ve had 4,621 views in the last 365 days for a total watch time of 280.7 hours. That&amp;rsquo;s an average of 5.4 hours per week, which is 13.5% of a 40 hour work week that we saved a full time employee on average per week this last year. For example, for a base salary of $x$ or $y$ that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;gt;10,000 or &amp;gt;20,000 USD in savings per year taking into account fringe costs. These videos remain in perpetuity, and while some might become outdated, they are definitely an asset for the institute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also curious to hear what arguments others use to convince their employers to let them apply to grants that limit indirect costs. For example, US-based institutions depend on those indirect costs to function, and will not like it if you apply for a grant that will limit your effort available for other grants if that grant provides, let&amp;rsquo;s say, less than 25% or 50% of the indirect costs other grantees provide. Direct costs are like research costs and salary support for your team. Like if you are doing so well that you get funding for 100% of your effort, then of course institutions would like it for you to have the max indirect costs rate possible. Though well, a grant with a lower indirect costs rate is better than no grant if you don&amp;rsquo;t have 100% funded effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe something funding bodies could do is request that a small portion of the grantees time is used to teach communities in need for these opportunities (here we are talking about Latin America, but it could be other ones). Another idea is that they could reward with a higher indirect cost rate those institutions that allow grantees to do this during work hours. These ideas might have no legs, but maybe they could. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While change takes a lot of effort and sometimes one might feel alone, I am definitely excited about the discussions we&amp;rsquo;ll have the next two days. Though I&amp;rsquo;m also aware of potential pitfalls, like fighting for a piece of the cake. Hopefully we can make the cake bigger!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/authors/admin/avatar_hub730ffb954e879fe0ab174cacb839b41_1326712_270x270_fill_lanczos_center_2.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long start to 2020 including the past four very busy weeks, I’m happy to announce that today March 16th 2020 I accepted a position as &lt;strong&gt;Research Scientist&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.libd.org/&#34;&gt;Lieber Institute for Brain Development&lt;/a&gt; in Baltimore, MD, USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/jRZXsVd7xbBAIF08eH&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;270&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-will-i-do-as-a-research-scientist-at-libd&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will I do as a Research Scientist at LIBD?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At LIBD we currently have the following scientific ranks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Technician&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Assistant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Associate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staff Scientist I, II and III&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Scientist (+ Lead and Senior)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigator (+ Lead and Senior)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Scientists carry out research, do so scholarly, are tasked with being creative, are encouraged to seek funding, and can have supervisory and mentor roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my agreement with LIBD, I will remain affiliated with the Data Science Team I led by &lt;a href=&#34;http://aejaffe.com/&#34;&gt;Andrew E Jaffe&lt;/a&gt; while also having the opportunity to interact with and collaborate with fantastic biologists, data scientists, and researchers at LIBD, Johns Hopkins University, and beyond. Furthermore, I will officially help mentor LIBD scientists in data science and R tools. LIBD will support me while I build a small team around my research interests and prepare my first set of grant submissions. There will be a transition period and many things I need to learn: from requesting a budget to writing a job ad, as well as many details about grant requests. But ultimately, LIBD offered me a launch pad for an academic career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/xiN0BXMETVsx0AxTXt&#34; width=&#34;315&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/usnationalarchives-night-nasa-xiN0BXMETVsx0AxTXt&#34;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;details&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my first tasks will be to refine the details of my role. For example, right now on the teaching side of things I’m imagining doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead a weekly &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/&#34;&gt;LIBD rstats club&lt;/a&gt; meeting where I can go over topics common to several users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold one-on-one data science guidance sessions, similar to the MPH capstone sessions I did during my teaching assistant years at JHBSPH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally lead internal workshops, which could benefit from workshops I prepare for &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34;&gt;CDSB&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href=&#34;https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/#info&#34;&gt;certified by RStudio&lt;/a&gt; and attend more R conferences &amp;amp; workshops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the scientific side, I will also learn more about the biological questions my LIBD colleagues are working on. These hypothesis-driven projects will provide me a new set of challenges and I will perform what me and my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lcg.unam.mx/&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; classmates were trained to do: to function as a bridge between multiple fields. I will also keep learning from my JHU colleagues and working with them as I refine my ideas. Currently, this is how I have framed my research interests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research aims to better understand the roots and signatures of disease (particularly psychiatric disorders) by zooming in across dimensions of gene activity: from studying gene expression at all feature levels (genes to exons to exon-exon junctions and un-annotated regions of expression), to using different gene expression measurement technologies (bulk RNA-seq, single cell/nuclei RNA-seq to spatial transcriptomics) that provide finer biological resolution and localization of gene expression. I’m interested in both hypothesis-driven projects as well as building general resources such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/&#34;&gt;recount2&lt;/a&gt; that enable us to contextualize our findings across all of the public human gene expression landscape. I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;R programming language&lt;/a&gt; for nearly all my work and like to organize my code in R packages that I share mostly through the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/&#34;&gt;Bioconductor project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for building my team, I know that overall one of the challenges everyone faces is recruiting talent. I’ll give this complicated process a shot by tapping into my network which includes many immigrants. I will also expand my network online and through conferences. Furthermore, I am committed to my outreach projects such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34;&gt;CDSB&lt;/a&gt; but will synergize them even more: re-use training materials, potentially recruit team members, and help me expand my network. In the meantime, if you are interested in working with me or my colleagues, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;final-decision&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final decision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision I had to make was challenging, but in the end, I decided to stay at LIBD because they offered me a path to become a principal investigator in academia which it’s something I want to explore and see where it leads me. I will also formally be someone’s boss and gain managerial experience, work much closer with biologists in hypothesis-driven projects, and overall gain more experience and skills. My brother’s job tasks changed last week, to which I told him: “welcome to the real world”. Well, I guess that’s how it’ll be for me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;acknowledgments&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone that helped me through this decision-making process, provided me with information, asked me questions, answered questions, expanded my universe, advocated for me, advised me, cheered for me, and supported me. Thank you! I look forward to working with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;origin-of-the-idea&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origin of the idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently the team I work with has had a few new members and I’ve been thinking lately of ways we could try to help them. The team leader was traveling this week, which gave me the opportunity to come up with a new type of session and test it out. That’s the origin of this &lt;em&gt;learning from our search history&lt;/em&gt; idea. We tested it today and I’m quite happy with the results so far, so I thought it would be useful to document what we did and share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;motivation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-theory&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The theory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I show in the slides below, in our group we follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/10/you-must-try-and-then-you-must-ask.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;you must try, and then you must ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; framework although with a little different interpretation. The basic goal is to search independently for a period of time (say 15 minutes), but then ask others for help if you are still stuck beyond that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async class=&#34;speakerdeck-embed&#34; data-id=&#34;a99280d748df4a88bf328e1bcaa8e95b&#34; data-ratio=&#34;1.29456384323641&#34; src=&#34;//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, you have to be able to find some answers yourself since that’s part of our job using resources that range from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google Search&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34;&gt;Bioconductor Support&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;RStudio Community&lt;/a&gt;, among other websites. However, we also acknowledge that some questions have difficult answers. Maybe a Stack Overflow thread has multiple answers and not necessarily the top voted question has the answer you are looking for. So instead of spending too much energy, we also tell our members to avoid getting into a rabbit hole for hours. That’s where asking for help comes to play. And you can ask for help from any community you belong to: those involved in the project through Slack, our full team, other scientists in our university, communities we belong to like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&amp;amp;src=typed_query&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;rstats&lt;/em&gt; community on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the Bioconductor users community at large, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did mention that it’s ideal to think about the person who will be helping you answer your question. Small reproducible examples, versions of the software you used, sharing your code on GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the commands you used and the order you used them in can all be valuable for resolving different types of problems. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JennyBryan&#34;&gt;Jenny Bryan&lt;/a&gt; has talked much more about this subject, for example in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars/help-me-help-you-creating-reproducible-examples-jenny-bryan&#34;&gt;2018 webinar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;in-practice&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In practice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying for a while then asking for help is all good in practice. However, &lt;strong&gt;asking for help is very challenging&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s scary, you open yourself because you show what you don’t know to other people, and sadly historically many questions have been met with negative feedback on the Internet. Thus, they can make you feel dumb, stupid and many other negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think that asking for help can be worth it and even wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/11/12/asking-for-help-is-challenging-but-is-typically-worth-it/&#34;&gt;previous blog post on this subject&lt;/a&gt;. Some reasons why it’s worth it include being able to move on with your work &lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you might learn something new, and if you follow the strategies for helping others help you, you might even figure out the answer yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we all ask for help regardless of how long we have been writing code. Here’s an example tweet that conveys the same message. There are thousands of such tweets online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I conduct approximately 3948234 programming-related Google searches per day. So does every other developer I know, whether they have 5 weeks of experience or 5 years. Help normalize this practice by tweeting your daily searches with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/devgoogle?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#devgoogle&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/XfNVUZlhC5&#34;&gt;https://t.co/XfNVUZlhC5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Lyzi Diamond (@lyzidiamond) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lyzidiamond/status/1085227527587561472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;January 15, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;we-are-diverse&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;We are diverse&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/media/amy_mph.jpg&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team (shown as of May 2018) we work at is very diverse because we all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have different backgrounds,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have acquired different skills,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are at different career stages (from rotation student up to associate professor),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have different interests,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use different operating systems (from Fedora to Ubuntu to macOS to Windows)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use different tools (mobaxterm vs putty, TextMate vs RStudio, …).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also because we seek help in different ways &lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and we learn differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we have a lot to learn from each other 😊🤓.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;learn-from-each-other-exercise&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn from each other exercise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/learnfromsearch&#34;&gt;bit.ly/learnfromsearch&lt;/a&gt; you can find a copy of the Google Spreadsheet with the information you need for your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;some-rules&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some rules&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to make sure that everyone will feel save to ask questions. That’s why I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reminded others about our code of conduct,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invited everyone to practice their empathy and be mindful that language matters &lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to keep everyone’s time in their mind as a question could lead to a longer discussion which is best to take another occasion. &lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;main-steps&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Main steps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you pick a problem you solved recently and share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what you were trying to solve,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the actual text you searched for in Google or elsewhere &lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the link of the website where you find your answer or that guided in this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We improved the steps as we were testing this!&lt;/em&gt; 🙌🏽🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everyone has contributed their information to the spreadsheet, we then proceed to go around the table showing and explaining our search use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;goals&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Goals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the goals of this exercise are to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;empower ourselves with the knowledge from our teammates,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn from how we all find help,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build a supportive environment where we feel comfortable asking for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus in the end, we are enabling our team to fully follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/10/you-must-try-and-then-you-must-ask.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;you must try, and then you must ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;test-session&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test session&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and only session so far went approximately like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 0-5: get settled in the room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 5-22: presentation about the idea to get members to buy into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 22-26: demonstration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 26-33: members prepared their information to share with the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 33-58: members presented their problems, the searches the did, and the solution(s) they found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 58-60: quick wrap up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;my-search-example&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My search example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/learnfromsearch&#34;&gt;bit.ly/learnfromsearch&lt;/a&gt; I left some examples (anonymized). Mine was about increasing the point size of the output of a plot made with &lt;code&gt;scater::plotReducedDim()&lt;/code&gt; which returns a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2&#34;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Wickham_2016&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org&#39;&gt;Wickham, 2016&lt;/a&gt;) object. Hence why I searched in Google for &lt;code&gt;ggplot2 increase point size&lt;/code&gt; which lead me to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;geom_point()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reference website. I then tried using &lt;code&gt;+ geom_point(size = 20)&lt;/code&gt; but that broke the color mapping. I was about to dive into the GitHub code for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.10/scater&#34;&gt;scater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-McCarthy_2017&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw777&#39;&gt;McCarthy, Campbell, Lun, and Willis, 2017&lt;/a&gt;) as this my go-to behavior for many similar quests, but I decided to check the help page using &lt;code&gt;?scater::plotReducedDim&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Additional arguments for visualization, see ?“scater-plot-args” for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation for &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; lead me to &lt;code&gt;?&#34;scater-plot-args&#34;&lt;/code&gt; where I finally found the &lt;code&gt;point_size&lt;/code&gt; argument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;point_size: Numeric scalar, specifying the size of the points. Defaults to NULL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that solved my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what used to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2020-02-12-learning-from-our-search-history_files/Screen%20Shot%202020-02-12%20at%209.54.41%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(&amp;#39;scater&amp;#39;)
library(&amp;#39;SummarizedExperiment&amp;#39;)

plotReducedDim(
    sce,
    dimred = &amp;#39;PCA&amp;#39;,
    colour_by = &amp;#39;my_cluster_variable&amp;#39;,
    theme_size = 20
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2020-02-12-learning-from-our-search-history_files/Screen%20Shot%202020-02-12%20at%209.55.09%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plotReducedDim(
    sce,
    dimred = &amp;#39;PCA&amp;#39;,
    colour_by = &amp;#39;my_cluster_variable&amp;#39;,
    theme_size = 20,
    point_size = 5
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples involve different websites and showcase the diversity of questions we have as a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you like this idea and try it out yourselves. Maybe some of the lessons you learn trying it out could be useful to us as well. Ultimately, the information stored there could be useful for new team members as well as for current members since the spreadsheet becomes like an informal FAQ or team wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/MRwR1blxryNJm&#34; width=&#34;315&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/MRwR1blxryNJm&#34;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was strongly encouraged by the feedback two members gave me individually after our trial session. Maybe this is not for everyone as we realized that it’s quite hard to be anonymous while participating &lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This idea could evolve into something else, but at least for today, I’m happy with the amount of people that bought into the trial and participated in it. We’ll see what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to acknowledge the general inspiration I’ve gotten from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill&#34;&gt;Alison Hill&lt;/a&gt;’s educational work. Once the &lt;code&gt;rstudio::conf(2020)&lt;/code&gt; videos are available, check the work her intern &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dcossyle&#34;&gt;Desirée de Leon&lt;/a&gt; showcased which is related to the following tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Ever seen a giraffe that can fit in a teacup?

&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you can link to specific lines and see things you changed through time that might be the source of the problem are among the main reasons why you should try to version control your code.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially to a more interesting problem than the one you are stuck currently at.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some use a particular project Slack channel, others the lab one, others through direct messages.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you say that something is obvious or easy, you are telling the other person that it should be easy for them too, but we know that it isn’t the case and that’s why they are asking a question.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want to incorporate this exercise into our weekly meetings (maybe once a month), we need to make sure that our team meeting will finish on time.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn6&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of keywords can dramatically affect a search results, and this information is useful to convey among ourselves so we can learn to search for help more effectively.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn7&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, you can only be anonymous for those not in the room at the time the question was discussed.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Today I’m excited to invite you to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/post/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34;&gt;Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018&lt;/a&gt;! It’ll be held in Cuernavaca, Mexico from July 30th to August 3rd, 2018. You can find the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/p/108108&#34;&gt;official announcement in the Bioconductor support website&lt;/a&gt;. Let me share with you why I’m excited about this workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2017/BioC2017/&#34;&gt;BioC2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://alejandroreyes.org/&#34;&gt;Alejandro Reyes&lt;/a&gt; and I talked for a while about the low representation of Latin Americans through out the years that either of us have attended the BioC meetings&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We wanted to see more Latin faces in person but also in the Bioconductor Support Website and among package contributors. We brainstormed for a while and a at dinner with Bioconductor core members we simply ran with our ideas: we brought up the subject and were pleasantly rewarded with support from the Bioconductor team (Alejandro did most of the convincing!). That is, if we organized a conference/workshop, they would help us by sending someone to be one of the instructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Alejandro and I had already discussed why we like the Bioc meetings so much. One of the keys is that the Bioc meetings have always had events for different levels of R users. That is, you can attend the conference each year and learn something new (that’s how I got my career started). So you can progress from learning R, to mastering several R packages, to contributing R packages to Bioconductor, to brainstorming future directions for the Bioconductor project&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the Bioc meetings have scientific talks in the mornings so that you can learn new scientific and R developments in a single conference. We’ve seen this model adapted in other Bioc events like BiocAsia, the European Bioconductor Meeting, etc. It would be ideal if we got to that point, but we wanted to start smaller with a focus on developing R packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/heladia-salgado-bb122954/&#34;&gt;Heladia Salgado&lt;/a&gt;, Romualdo Zayas and others from CCG-UNAM&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and NNB-UNAM&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have organized the &lt;a href=&#34;http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/&#34;&gt;“Talleres Internacionales de Bioinformática”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (TIBs) for years now. Actually, I was a student in 2006 and gave a lecture in the summer 2010 event. At the TIBs they’ve had an introductory R class for a few years now where &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/selenefernandez/&#34;&gt;Selene Fernandez-Valverde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://liigh.unam.mx/amedina/&#34;&gt;Alejandra Medina-Rivera&lt;/a&gt; have participated as instructors. Among the feedback they’ve received is the desire for a more advanced R course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alejandro and I talked to Alejandra Medina-Rivera who shared our enthusiasm for Bioconductor. As a PI in Mexico, Alejandra knows very well how sparse are the R/Bioconductor courses that she can send her students to. By the way, Alejandra is the one who first invited me to attend BioC2008!&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We quickly started an email thread with Heladia and basically, the pieces started to fall in the right places. Heladia, Delfino Garcia-Alonso, Daniela Ledezma, Laura Gómez, Shirley Alquicira, Thalia Uranga Martínez, among others have been instrumental in organizing the workshop. Heladia, Alejandra and others also secured crucial funding from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ccg.unam.mx/&#34;&gt;CCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://liigh.unam.mx/&#34;&gt;LIIGH-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;. Together we were able to invite and get all the logistics so that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.roswellpark.org/martin-morgan&#34;&gt;Martin Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heatherturner.net/&#34;&gt;Heather Turner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.somos.unicamp.br/professores/view/4722&#34;&gt;Benilton Carvalho&lt;/a&gt;, Selene Fernandez-Valverde, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.teresa-ortiz.com/eng&#34;&gt;María Teresa Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mastrettayanes-lab.org/&#34;&gt;Alicia Mastretta Yanes&lt;/a&gt; could all help us teach part of the workshop and/or present their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, these are some of the reasons why they are amazing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martin: Bioconductor project leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heather: extensive experience teaching R and bioinformatics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benilton: he helped organize a similar workshop in 2015: &lt;a href=&#34;http://lab.foundation/&#34;&gt;LAb Foundation Brasil&lt;/a&gt;. Also an academic relative of Alejandro and myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selene: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fondationloreal.com/categories/for-women-in-science/lang/en&#34;&gt;L’Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science&lt;/a&gt;, has taught at TIBs before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/rladiescdmx/&#34;&gt;RLadiesCDMX&lt;/a&gt; plus just look at her awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tereom?tab=repositories&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; profile!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alicia: she has taught an intro to bioinformatics and reproducible genetic analyses course, plus check her &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AliciaMstt?tab=repositories&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; profile!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/post/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34;&gt;workshop schedule&lt;/a&gt; we have, you’ll notice that we will have several sessions devoted to actually writing R packages. So the course will cover both the theory and the practice side of things. If you attend the workshop, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to network with your peers and to learn from other R developers. You should be super excited now!! ^^ Plus we have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ComunidadBioInfo/R-BioConductor-Developers-Workshop-2018/blob/master/R-Bioconductor-2018_Program.rmd#code-of-conduct&#34;&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt; (en &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/codigo-de-conducta/&#34;&gt;Español&lt;/a&gt;) to ensure that the conference will be welcoming to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a reminder that you have to keep trying. Back in 2009 or 2010 I had gotten an offer of support from Bioc for sending someone to Cuernavaca, but due to funding circumstances it fell through. Like I said, all the pieces fell in the right places this time. Plus Heladia Salgado has made it all possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 is looking like a good year for R courses in Latin America. For example, there’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://latin-r.com/en&#34;&gt;LatinR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/&#34;&gt;Buenos Aires RLadies&lt;/a&gt; plus our workshop! Fingers crossed, I’ll be able to attend the workshop in 2019!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I’m excited to invite you to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/post/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34;&gt;Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018&lt;/a&gt;! Regardless of whether you can attend it, help us spread the word:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be in that order. For example, anyone attending the Bioc meeting is welcome at the Developer’s Day and to chime in the discussions about the Bioconductor project.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centro de Ciencias Genómicas: Center for Genomic Sciences&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn6&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then taught a few courses at LCG-UNAM, CCG-UNAM and IBT-UNAM from 2008 to 2011 with some slides in Spanish and English. Alejandro was my TA for one of these courses! For a few years since then I would get emails in Spanish asking about some of those courses. You can still find those courses online, but I bet that the material is outdated. In any case, it’s another example of the limited training opportunities.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Teaching a short topic to beginner R users</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2015/07/07/rmarkdown/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2015/07/07/rmarkdown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I was given the opportunity to teach a 1 hr 30 min slot of an introduction to &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; course. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve taught lectures for similar courses, and I ended up asking myself what would be the best short topic to teach and how to teach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;best-short-topic&#34;&gt;Best short topic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to answer the first question, one boring and one more interesting. The boring answer is that the course instructor selected the topic. The interesting one goes like this. I have taken short &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; courses before and taught others, and it&amp;rsquo;s always overwhelming for the students. You get to cover many concepts, get familiarized with &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s syntax, and in the end without lots of practice it&amp;rsquo;s very challenging to retain much of the information. I think that students love it when they learn how to do something simple that could be the first building block for many of their projects. In parallel, I think that one of the coolest &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; topics you can learn in an hour is how to create reproducible documents with &lt;code&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-rmarkdown&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown&#39;&gt;Allaire, Cheng, Xie, McPherson, et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning how to use a single function, &lt;code&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; in this case, is as simple as it gets. And using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RStudio Desktop&lt;/a&gt; is even simpler. Of course, it can easily get complicated. For example, on a new computer you need to install all the LaTeX dependencies if you want to create PDF files. That task can take some time and maybe scare away some new users. But PDF files are really a plus in this case since you can start creating HTML and Word documents. Other complications arise when a user is interested in more control over formatting the file, but like I said earlier, all you need is a simple building block and &lt;code&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/code&gt; is clearly one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the final answer to the first question was teaching how to use &lt;code&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/code&gt; to create reproducible reports (HTML, Word files) using &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-teach-it&#34;&gt;How to teach it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching a short topic to a beginner&amp;rsquo;s audience is no easy feat. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve made lectures that have the code for every single step and many links to resources where students can learn some details. That is, I&amp;rsquo;ve created the lectures in such a way that a student can later use them as reference and follow them without an instructor explaining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a strategy that I think works on the long run. However, it makes the actual lecture boring and very limited in interactivity. At the JHSPH biostat computing club, other students have chosen to use a lot of images, funny to witty quotes, and asked listeners to voice their opinions. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to enjoy those presentations and I decided to create my lecture following that trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off with a series of questions about reproducible research and asked students to voice their opinions and to define a few key concepts. A couple were aware of the difference between reproducibility and replicability, but most were not. I also questioned them and presented them verbally with some famous cases, so they could realize that it&amp;rsquo;s a fairly complicated matter. Next I presented some answers and definitions from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/s9tya/wiki/home/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementing Reproducible Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically talking about &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, I showed the students several documents I&amp;rsquo;ve created in the past and asked whether they thought that they could reproduce the results or not. Basically, I wanted to highlight that when using &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, you really need the session information if you want to reproduce something. Specially if the analysis involves packages under heavy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having motivating the need for reproducible documents, I briefly showed what &lt;code&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/code&gt; is with some images from RStudio shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/images/markdownOverview.png&#34; alt=&#34;Markdown overview&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/images/markdownChunk.png&#34; alt=&#34;Markdown and R&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gave the students a general idea of how these documents look when you are writing them. But the most important part was showing them examples of how the resulting documents look like. That is, I showed them some complicated projects so they could imagine doing one themselves. The examples included some books, but given the audience I think that the one that motivated them most was Alyssa Frazee&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;polyester&lt;/code&gt; reproducible paper (check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/leekgroup/polyester_code/blob/master/polyester_manuscript.Rmd&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;source here&lt;/a&gt;). I also showed them some of the cool stuff you can create with HTML documents: basically adding interactive elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, we left the presentation and I demo&amp;rsquo;ed how to use RStudio to write &lt;code&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/code&gt; documents, the Markdown syntax, where to find help, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dgdc5.digitalgameslearning.org/dgdc_5th/wp-content/uploads/lc.png&#34; alt=&#34;Lets code&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, I think the lecture was quite complete and the students were motivated. However, from my past experience, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize that students will easily forget a topic if they don&amp;rsquo;t practice doing it. That is why even before making the lecture I spent quite a bit of time designing two practice labs. Both labs involved creating a &lt;code&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/code&gt; document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first lab included some cool illusion plots which involved a lot of &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; code. The code wasn&amp;rsquo;t the point, but simply learning some of the basics such as what is a code chunk, some of Markdown&amp;rsquo;s syntax, specifying some code chunk options, adding the session information, and using inline &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; code to show the date when the document was made. Ahh, and of course, uploading your HTML document to &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RPubs&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/lcollado/illussion2015&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;). I know that not everyone is a fan of RPubs, but I imagined that students would get super excited that they made something that they could then show their colleagues and friends. And some did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time for the second lab. I did explain to the students what it was about, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to do it themselves. For this second document, I wanted the students to learn how to create a document reporting some results where all the numbers in the text are written by &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; instead of copy-pasting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I enjoyed thinking what to teach and specially how to teach a short topic to beginner &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; students. Thanks to having one of the later sessions, I could teach them how to use &lt;code&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/code&gt; in a way that hopefully left them highly motivated to do it themselves. I hope that most of them will take that they learned in that module and others and apply them in their day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the lecture itself &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aejaffe.com/summerR_2015/modules/module12.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but like I said earlier, it was designed for class and not for being used as a reference. However, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aejaffe.com/summerR_2015/labs/module12_lab.R&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;lab&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aejaffe.com/summerR_2015/labs/mapping_module_labkey.R&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; might be more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citations made with &lt;code&gt;knitcitations&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-knitcitations&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitcitations&#39;&gt;Boettiger, 2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My strategy for quickly grading homeworks</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/11/08/fast-grading/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/11/08/fast-grading/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past year and a half &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/teaching.html#.Un2BnJTF2Ql&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;I have been a teaching assistant&lt;/a&gt; (TA) for the Statistical Methods in Public Health I to IV (140.621 to 140.624) courses. As part of being a TA for these courses, we have to grade between 30 and 50 homeworks every two weeks or so: four problem sets per eight week terms. For example, I now have to grade 37 homeworks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/list-to-grade.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/list-to-grade.png&#34; alt=&#34;HWs to grade&#34; style=&#34;width: 400px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These courses have been polished over time and the instructors do a great job organizing the TA group. For every problem set that we have to grade, we are given a full answer key that is later published in the course site so all the students can access it. As TAs we also receive general grading comments from the instructor; typically a two page document describing the key points that we should expect the students to be able to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the general grading comments, we are asked to give feedback beyond checkmarks such as &amp;ldquo;good job&amp;rdquo;. When the student completely misses the answer, we can simply refer them to the answer key: if they miss too many, we ask them to re-do the homework. Things get more complicated when the student misses part of the question and writing comments specific to that answer can get very time consuming. We can always use &amp;ldquo;More detailed discussion on results needed. See answer key.&amp;rdquo; but it can be nice for the student if we give them a hint on what they did wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a student &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jhubiostat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;@jhubiostat&lt;/a&gt; we agree to dedicate five hours per week to TA responsibilities. In the courses I have been a TA for, the responsibilities include getting familiar with the content, attending TA office hours (either general questions or STATA questions), attending the TA meetings, grading the exams, and grading the homeworks. It might sound like a lot, but I currently feel like I can it all done within the five hours per week. To do so, I obviously need to be efficient grading the homeworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how I do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Adobe Acrobat Pro&lt;/a&gt; which I believe we can get through Hopkins for free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alfred v2&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Powerpack&lt;/a&gt; purchased/installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Adobe Acrobat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adobe Acrobat allows you to post &amp;ldquo;stamps&amp;rdquo;. It already includes a checkmark and a red &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt;. I also imported some simple images I made to stamp the homework as: satisfactory, unsatisfactory, or incomplete. We have to clearly mark one of these options at the top of the graded homeworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the PDF files we get are large, so I use the &lt;code&gt;Save as -&amp;gt; reduced size pdf&lt;/code&gt; tool from Adobe Acrobat to save space and make it easier for the course administrator to upload the graded homeworks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://courseplus.jhsph.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CoursePlus&lt;/a&gt; (the tool the school uses for managing courses).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alfred v2&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For grading homeworks all I really need is a software that can remember my recent copy-pastes and make it easy for me to choose among them to paste them back. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clipmenu.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ClipMenu&lt;/a&gt; can do the job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alfred v2&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;Clipboard&lt;/code&gt; feature which does the above. Compared to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clipmenu.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ClipMenu&lt;/a&gt; it has the advantage of allowing you to search within the recent copy-pastes, making it easy to find the comment you want to paste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are on Windows or Linux, there must be some programs that have this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;grading-workflow&#34;&gt;Grading workflow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;most-used-comment-good-job&#34;&gt;Most used comment: Good job!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me begin with a very simple case. Basically, you find a answer that is well done and you want to compliment the student for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the homework I am currently grading, the students have to compute the 95 percent confidence interval for the difference in two proportions using the formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \hat p_1 - \hat p_2 \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{ \frac{ \hat p_1 (1 - \hat p_1)}{ n_1} + \frac{ \hat p_2 (1 - \hat p_2)}{ n_2} } $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which leads to (0.00142, 0.00798) with the data they are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anonymous student (I tried to choose examples that are not identifiable) wrote an answer that has very similar numbers to those we expect. Since they included the STATA output I can recognize that they used rounded numbers (oddly only for sample 1 but not sample 2) which lead the student to slightly different values. That is not a big deal and I think it deserves the &amp;ldquo;good job!&amp;rdquo; comment. So using the &amp;ldquo;stamps&amp;rdquo;, I added a checkmark. Then I typed &amp;ldquo;Good job!&amp;rdquo; and finally, I copied it so I can paste it the next time I want to add this comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below shows the state at which I am copying the comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/goodjob1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/goodjob1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Good job 1&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on, I later found another student that has the correct answer presented in a different format. If &amp;ldquo;Good job!&amp;rdquo; is the most recent comment on my clipboard, I can simply paste it. If it is not, then I can use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alfred v2&lt;/a&gt; to show me my recent &amp;ldquo;copies&amp;rdquo; and select &amp;ldquo;Good job!&amp;rdquo; from the list. In this case it is under &lt;code&gt;cmd + 2&lt;/code&gt;; you can also use the arrows and the return key, or the mouse. Although note that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alfred v2&lt;/a&gt; is designed in such a way that you only have to use the keyboard to gain efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/goodjob2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/goodjob2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Good job 2&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is a green checkmark with the &amp;ldquo;Good job!&amp;rdquo; comment pasted into it. The next time I use &lt;code&gt;cmd + v&lt;/code&gt; (the regular paste shortcut in Mac), &amp;ldquo;Good job!&amp;rdquo; will be pasted. So you only really need to invoke &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alfred v2&lt;/a&gt; when you want to change comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;detailed-comments-where-the-strategy-pays-off&#34;&gt;Detailed comments: where the strategy pays off!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You obviously do not all this setup just for pasting &amp;ldquo;Good job!&amp;rdquo; everywhere. However, when grading homeworks you will encounter much more complicated cases where you might need to write a short explanation, point the student to the answer key, etc. To save time you want to minimize having to type the long comments each time you need to. That is where this strategy pays its dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, I first find a plot that looks very similar to what the students were asked to do. It has a couple of mistakes. First, the age-gender group categories are not labeled in the plot, which makes it impossible to know which group is which unless you know how &lt;em&gt;agegen&lt;/em&gt; is coded. Given that it is the first time students were asked to make such a detailed plot, I can expect other students to make the same mistake. So I copy that comment and add it to my clipboard history as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/ci1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/ci1.png&#34; alt=&#34;CI 1&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular plot has another problem in that the confidence bands look much smaller than expected. The estimates per se look comparable to the expected plot, so I suspect that the student either used the wrong standard errors or forgot to multiply them by 1.96. So I copy this comment separately and add it to my clipboard history. Maybe other students made the same mistake, maybe they did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/ci2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/ci2.png&#34; alt=&#34;CI 2&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having copied both comments separately, I am now ready for cases where they forget to label the X axis, use the wrong confidence bands, or make both mistakes together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I find another homework that has labels on the X axis. So instead of typing my comment, I simply invoke &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alfred v2&lt;/a&gt; and search the appropriate comment as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/ci3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/ci3.png&#34; alt=&#34;CI 3&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my comment list is getting long, using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alfred v2&lt;/a&gt; I can easily search my clipboard history by typing keywords. In this particular case, I know that my comment had something to do with the &amp;ldquo;axis&amp;rdquo;, so typing it in I quickly find the comment I want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/ci4.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/ci4.png&#34; alt=&#34;CI 4&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And voila! The comment is pasted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/ci5.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/figs/2013-11-08-fast-grading/ci5.png&#34; alt=&#34;CI 5&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternatives&#34;&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative implementation is to create a spreadsheet where you manually save the comments you are using while grading the homework. When you want to use them, you open the spreadsheet, select the comment, manually copy it, and then you are set to paste it. Using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alfred v2&lt;/a&gt; basically makes this a bit faster, but the key point is to save the comments in a way that you can re-use them and combine them if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more pointers on this alternative, ask &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/YennyWebbV&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;@YennyWebbV&lt;/a&gt; who is an expert at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that others find this strategy useful. In my case, I went from taking 9-11 hours to grade homeworks when I first began as a TA to grading them in 3-4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
