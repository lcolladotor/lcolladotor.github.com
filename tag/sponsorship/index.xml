      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently gave a remote seminar presentation for the &lt;em&gt;Applications of Genomics 2024-2025&lt;/em&gt; course organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ccg.unam.mx/maria-esperanza-martinez-romero/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Esperanza Martínez Romero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsky.app/profile/alezayas.bsky.social&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alejandra Zayas Del Moral&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was to talk about my career and showcase some recent research work from my team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also wanted to take the opportunity to talk about the importance of community building and relying on the support from your communities as you advance in your career. I&amp;rsquo;m from the third class of LCG-UNAM undergraduate program on Genomic Sciences from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and graduated in 2009 (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/11/06/a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my timeline blog post&lt;/a&gt; for more details). That means that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have as many people to look up to as you do now. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short extract of how I relayed some of this to the students at the end of my seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OVMw0k6AydA?si=-km8P5ei3SfBSeyC&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak Spanish, YouTube can auto-translate the captions to your language of choice ^^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lcgej-unam-network&#34;&gt;LCG(EJ)-UNAM network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you are a current student and want to tap into the LCG(EJ)-UNAM network. Well, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lcg.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://lcgej.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LCG-EJ-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; network is actually not that easy to find 😔.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the two sibling undergrad programs are actually run by different people, both from UNAM. I personally consider them to be part of the same group (particularly from an international lens) as I think that diving them is not helpful. Though I understand that each program has specific areas they want to emphasize, different funding issues, and different challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;emails&#34;&gt;Emails&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so maybe one way to get in touch with others is via email. For LCG-UNAM there&amp;rsquo;s a mailing list for everyone, but that only includes &lt;code&gt;@lcg.unam.mx&lt;/code&gt; emails which many alumni don&amp;rsquo;t check/use anymore. For LCG-EJ-UNAM I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that there&amp;rsquo;s no mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each class in LCG-UNAM there&amp;rsquo;s also another mailing list, but well, they have the same issue of only including &lt;code&gt;@lcg.unam.mx&lt;/code&gt; emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the lead to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lcg.unam.mx/international-symposium-for-the-20th-anniversary-of-the-bachelors-program-in-genomic-sciences-lcg-unam/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LCG20 celebrations&lt;/a&gt; (20 year anniversary of LCG-UNAM), a Google Sheet was spread around where people wrote down their name, class, and email. So I&amp;rsquo;ve also used that email list (many of which are &lt;code&gt;@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; accounts) too. There are 130 emails listed here (some with typos!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;facebook&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LCG-UNAM alumni have set up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/21720863576&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;private Facebook group&lt;/a&gt;. It currently has 355 members. I see that some members are LCG-EJ-UNAM alumni, so I believe that both programs are welcome there. This is probably the one resource most people use when trying to ask for help or share opportunities. However, many don&amp;rsquo;t use Facebook anymore, so I wonder how many of the members are actually active. It does have the benefit of being a private group, unlike other social media platforms. So I think that this Facebook group will continue to be one of the main ways to get in touch with LCG(EJ)-UNAM alumni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;slack&#34;&gt;Slack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might know, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/19/using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Slack for communicating for work&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, as far as I know, there&amp;rsquo;s no LCG(EJ)-UNAM Slack workspace. However, as co-founder of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been encouraging people to join us at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://join.slack.com/t/comunidadbioinfo/shared_invite/zt-8lsvpm84-Fne1W0hadk6cpjgJS17Tnw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CDSB Slack workspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way I do so is by asking students from the LCG and LCG-EJ courses I have taught to join the CDSB Slack where I set up a channel for the course and communicate with them through it. Then once the course is over, they are part of the CDSB Slack and can network with others there. This Slack workspace isn&amp;rsquo;t as active as I would like it to be, but well, it&amp;rsquo;s a start. It currently has 396 members on the &lt;code&gt;#general&lt;/code&gt; channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xtwitter-and-now-bluesky&#34;&gt;X/Twitter and now Bluesky&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my courses I have also encouraged students to create a Twitter account to be able to network with other scientists at large, get their name out there, and meet people who can help them along the way. Maybe indirectly, just by sharing interesting resources. Maybe directly, by asking each other questions and then possibly meeting up in person later on. Some LCG-UNAM alumni historically were very active on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bluesky-has-taken-off&#34;&gt;Bluesky has taken off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, X/Twitter isn&amp;rsquo;t what it used to be. In recent weeks, the open-source alternative &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsky.app/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; has taken off. In 2023 you had to get a code to join, which made it really unfeasible to get students to join or the community at large. But things are different now at the end of 2024 and Bluesky has really taken off lately. One of the reasons is starter packs, which allow anyone to recommend up to 150 accounts that others might want to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One personal reason why I had still being using X/Twitter was because I felt that my community of genomics scientists trained in Mexico, working in Mexico, or helping train Mexicans wasn&amp;rsquo;t represented in Bluesky. I appreciate that I was included in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsky.app/profile/jeremy-data.bsky.social/post/3l6x3gmsxqe2z&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;RStats Starter Pack&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsky.app/profile/jeremy-data.bsky.social&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jeremy Allen&lt;/a&gt;, which has really helped with my visibility. As I&amp;rsquo;d like to make the full switch to Bluesky, I&amp;rsquo;m using my new found visibility to try to encourage others to make the switch as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genomics-scientists-trainedworking-in-mexico-&#34;&gt;Genomics scientists trained/working in Mexico 🇲🇽&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try to implement my wishes, I created &lt;a href=&#34;https://go.bsky.app/5bWBN5V&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a Bluesky starter pack&lt;/a&gt;. The name is limited to 50 characters, but well, I wanted to make it broad in a sense: anyone who has been trained in Mexico, works in Mexico (don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a Mexican citizen), or has helped train Mexicans within the genomics scientific domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://go.bsky.app/5bWBN5V&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/Genomics_scientists_trained_working_in_Mexico_Share_Card.png&#34; alt=&#34;QR code for the starter pack&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition definitely includes LCG-UNAM and LCG-EJ-UNAM members, but also CDSB, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.redmexicanadebioinformatica.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RMB&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nnb.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NNB-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; workshops alumni. Plus scientists working or involved with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ccg.unam.mx/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ibt.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IBt-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsky.app/profile/liigh-unam.bsky.social&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LIIGH-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;, among other institutions. Yes, UNAM is highly prevalent right now for many reasons, but one of them being that I was trained at LCG-UNAM and thus know more about that network right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-people-to-join-bluesky&#34;&gt;Getting people to join Bluesky&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I found close to 30 Bluesky accounts for the starter pack. Most of them I knew of already since we had been sharing Bluesky codes via WhatsApp and other media in 2023 to try to get people to join Bluesky. To get more, I wrote about the starter pack to the &lt;code&gt;@lcg.unam.mx&lt;/code&gt; mailing list, the list of 130 LCG alumni emails, as well as posted about it on Facebook, X/Twitter, CDSB Slack, and LinkedIn. And of course, Bluesky itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I know that a mass message like that is only going to get so much attention. So I applied a thing I learned from &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsky.app/profile/areyesq.bsky.social&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alejandro Reyes&lt;/a&gt; while working together in the first years of CDSB&amp;rsquo;s existence. That is, contact people directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted 147 X accounts via DM and 9 via public posts from people I follow on X/Twitter. I also emailed all the organizers of &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladiesmx.netlify.app/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RLadiesMX&lt;/a&gt; since I think that it would be great for them to also join Bluesky. I also need to contact the communities listed at on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lcolladotor.github.io/jhustatcomputing/posts/25-python-for-r-users/#community&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JHU Statistical Computing course website&lt;/a&gt;. I also texted some via WhatsApp since they have Bluesky accounts that are inactive, and thus I cannot add them to the starter pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/Screenshot 2024-11-11 at 1.31.16 PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;JHU stat computing community building screenshot&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d say that between a third to a half of them have replied so far. Many ask: &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Bluesky?&lt;/em&gt;. Others had heard about it about but had no invitation code to join in 2023 and didn&amp;rsquo;t know that you no longer need a code. Others are hesitant to start an account in a new social media platform. But most are eager to join and soon after have created their Bluesky account (some even had one that I missed!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we have 77 accounts listed on the starter pack out of the max 150. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have to make a part 2, or maybe even a part 3 starter pack later down the road. But well, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see more of us join Bluesky. After all, I want our voices to be heard and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to do so if we are not in the conversation to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one weekend of time can make a huge different in community building. But well, once you get the ball moving a bit, it&amp;rsquo;s up to the community to take it from there. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see where this goes and how we can help each other out in the future 🙌🏽 🇲🇽 🧬 ^_^.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conference feelings: from newbie to sponsor</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2020/02/03/conference-feelings-from-newbie-to-sponsor/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2020/02/03/conference-feelings-from-newbie-to-sponsor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2008, nearly 12 years ago, I attended my first R/Bioconductor conference: &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2008/BioC2008/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BioC2008&lt;/a&gt;. Just last week I went to my second &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/conference/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rstudio::conf(2020)&lt;/a&gt; which I greatly enjoyed. After some &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1224512627017244673?s=20&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tweets exchanges today&lt;/a&gt;, I started reflecting on my journey and wanted to share my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-i-like-going-to-conferences&#34;&gt;Why I like going to conferences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typically enjoy going to conferences, though I also end up exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/l3V0p1WFoSIrzPLW0&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/l3V0p1WFoSIrzPLW0&#34;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of it could be the traveling and all that goes with it, but I think that conferences are mostly mentally taxing. There’s an information deluge which I typically find overwhelming. Sure, I love finding about new work but at some point it’s like collecting bookmarks of stuff to read or try out later &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Yet the most exhausting component of going to a conference could be the networking aspect. Meeting others and catching up with friends is &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; rewarding which is why I ultimately sign up for the next conference. How rewarding can it be? My most extreme example is when two professors invited me to apply to the Ph.D. program that I ended up studying. Though simply making friends and having friendly faces around you can go a long way. I’ll expand a bit on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;as-a-newbie&#34;&gt;As a newbie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across my career I have felt as a &lt;em&gt;newbie&lt;/em&gt; when attending many different conferences. I might be alone or maybe have a friend at the conference, or it could be my first time at a conference that I haven’t been to. Your mind, like mine, can be filled up with questions that later might seem simple like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should I dress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it ok to drink alcohol? &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I not feel alone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I the odd one here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I talk to X or Y person I’ve heard about before but never met?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answers have likely changed over time and currently are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable, but remember that this is a work event. So look professional by getting a haircut and dressing up a bit &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, but not too much and if I don’t want any, that’s ok too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to whoever seems friendly: could be someone new or an old friend or acquaintance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe, but &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; 🤷🏽‍♂️. I do try talking to other latinos or foreigners specially when there’s not many of us around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This one is still hard, but maybe someone I know knows them and can introduce me. If so, I ask for the favor. Otherwise I try to approach them with a question about their work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;as-a-sponsor&#34;&gt;As a… &lt;em&gt;sponsor&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to avoid feeling alone is something that can still shape my behavior at a conference. If possible, I like having some close friends I can hang out with and be relaxed, almost as if we were not at the conference. They provide a zone that I can enter, recharge, and then head out of it again to continue networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet recently, I’ve grown more conscious of the fact that I’ve been around longer than others. Meaning that I might be the person that knows X or Y that they want to meet or talk to. That is, I find myself more frequently in the position of introducing people and helping them make connections. Somehow asking X or Y: “hey, do you have a minute? Can I introduce you to someone?” is way less scary even if I’m not the closest acquaintance of X or Y. That is, becoming a &lt;em&gt;sponsor&lt;/em&gt;: mostly the &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; portion as defined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://hookedondata.org/the-importance-of-sponsorship/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this blog post by Emily Robinson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I still network like I used to, a portion of my time is spent checking on others I know so they are not alone and helping them when possible make the connections they want. Doing so also helps me strengthen my own connections as I detailed near the end of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1224034242537119744?s=20&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tweet series post-rstudio::conf(2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m just trying to emulate what others have done for me in the past (too many to list, thank youuu!), as I know that getting someone to answer the doorbell is the first step towards opening a door🤗🙌🏾&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; 11/11&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Leonardo Collado-Torres (@lcolladotor) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1224034315429994502?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;February 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;feeling-empowered&#34;&gt;Feeling empowered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching out and trying to meet someone is hard and scary. Something that helped me since BioC2008 was the fact that I had others in mind: I knew that I was going to teach R later that fall at LCG-UNAM, so any questions I could get through or people I could meet were huge wins for me. Thus, thinking about others empowered me to network. And that’s still true for me through our CDSB project at &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;comunidadbioinfo.github.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m still feeling shy or alone, I remember a story from my dad: he claims that without approaching others who were having dinner at a table, introducing himself and creating a social connection, his ideas would have not made the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9278503&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; genome paper&lt;/a&gt; that helped launch his career. Personally, once I break that barrier and start to feel comfortable, I feel like I can ask anything: specially feedback and support from others on how to advance some ideas of mine. Lately, that’s mostly been related to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CDSB&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish others could feel empowered too, yet it’s hard to get there. For now, I simply try to help others emulating what others have done for me. Ultimately, I know that getting someone to answer the doorbell is the first step towards opening a door 🤗🙌🏾 which motivates me and helps me overcome my shyness. Whatever they do after someone answers the doorbell is up to the person I’m helping. Yet in that moment, the satisfaction of helping others make connections fulfills me. Later on, it brings a smile to my face even if I’m exhausted after the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why I have recently taken to Twitter to take “notes”. Notes that I make public and not necessarily go back and revisit, but if I want to, I know where they are.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or not drink alcohol. Whichever you want.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t wear suits or anything like that though.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
