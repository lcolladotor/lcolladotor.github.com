      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited for the opportunity to participate at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CZILatAmMtg&amp;amp;src=typed_query&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#CZILatAmMtg&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cziscience&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CZI Science&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m also thankful to those who nominated me, and in particular to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AleMedinaRivera&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alejandra Medina Rivera&lt;/a&gt;. I believe that one of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;m here is for my volunteer work at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico (CDSB), where &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/#people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; have made very important contributions. Some also know me from my time in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bioconductor Community Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt;, from which I stepped down earlier this year once my 3 year term ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I have been sharing with some other event attendees that I do feel burned out. I had envisioned that at CDSB we would train and empower those who would eventually replace us. And we&amp;rsquo;ve had quite a bit of success in doing so (3/7 CDSB board members are not founders). However, it&amp;rsquo;s been limited to a few key new volunteers, who then they risk burning out themselves. Since I want CDSB to continue on for many more years to come, I sometimes feel like I should again involve myself on organizing CDSB events. Doing so would involve volunteering on my free time. Given my position as a principal investigator, I actually spend more extra hours on activities related to that job, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much free time to give. There are also other non-academic interests I want to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I want to chat with others that organize short courses through their own organizations to learn how they plan to pass on the torch and see if those ideas can apply to CDSB as well as renew my own fire. Maybe others don&amp;rsquo;t plan to pass on the torch for many years as organizing these short courses becomes part of their main job. At CDSB (and LCG-UNAM) courses, I like the path of having students in year 1, that become teaching assistants in year 2, that then teach a portion of the course in year 3, then can organize part of or a full course in year 4. But that&amp;rsquo;s a long ramp, and I think that I failed to anticipate what would happen after year 4. Like there needs to be more structure to help them continue this cycle and reach a point where they can apply for grants without the names of the founders. I also failed to notice that founders would need to be involved for a longer period of time, until we reach a larger critical mass of highly trained volunteers, which at time point can fully replace us and keep CDSB going for more years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I also have other questions and topics I want to discuss with others. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m really curious to learn about justifications others use to convince their employers to let them spend work time on these type of initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some arguments I&amp;rsquo;ve used are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are training the future staff we want to recruit. I learned this from a former &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sacnas.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SACNAS&lt;/a&gt; president and it was useful to argue for time to teach (in my case in Mexico) without having to take vacations time to do so for a week or two per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is one I used recently in the context of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LIBD rstats club&lt;/a&gt; I organize at work: &amp;ldquo;YouTube analytics tell me that we&amp;rsquo;ve had 4,621 views in the last 365 days for a total watch time of 280.7 hours. That&amp;rsquo;s an average of 5.4 hours per week, which is 13.5% of a 40 hour work week that we saved a full time employee on average per week this last year. For example, for a base salary of $x$ or $y$ that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;gt;10,000 or &amp;gt;20,000 USD in savings per year taking into account fringe costs. These videos remain in perpetuity, and while some might become outdated, they are definitely an asset for the institute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also curious to hear what arguments others use to convince their employers to let them apply to grants that limit indirect costs. For example, US-based institutions depend on those indirect costs to function, and will not like it if you apply for a grant that will limit your effort available for other grants if that grant provides, let&amp;rsquo;s say, less than 25% or 50% of the indirect costs other grants provide. Direct costs are like research costs and salary support for your team. Like if you are doing so well that you get funding for 100% of your effort, then of course institutions would like it for you to have the max indirect costs rate possible. Though well, a grant with a lower indirect costs rate is better than no grant if you don&amp;rsquo;t have 100% funded effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe something funding bodies could do is request that a small portion of the grantees time is used to teach communities in need for these opportunities (here we are talking about Latin America, but it could be other ones). Another idea is that they could reward with a higher indirect cost rate those institutions that allow grantees to do this during work hours. These ideas might have no legs, but maybe they could. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While change takes a lot of effort and sometimes one might feel alone, I am definitely excited about the discussions we&amp;rsquo;ll have the next two days. Though I&amp;rsquo;m also aware of potential pitfalls, like fighting for a piece of the cake. Hopefully we can make the cake bigger!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;m disappointed by the reaction against the Tokyo 2020 Mexican Women Softball team</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2021/07/30/tokyo2020-mexico-softball-controversy/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2021/07/30/tokyo2020-mexico-softball-controversy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday there was a controversy because the Mexican Women&amp;rsquo;s softball team at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_women%27s_national_softball_team&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/mexicosoftball/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;) threw several uniforms and equipment to the trash (source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/31912575/olympics-2021-mexico-softball-team-tosses-uniforms-olympic-village-trash&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;). Right now I&amp;rsquo;m really disappointed with the negative reaction and personal attacks against the members of said team. At the same time, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to remain silent so I decided to write this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you live outside of your ancestral country. People see you differently and tell you to go back to the country you came from. This is a reality that inmigrants around the world live through frequently, including Mexicans and their descendants in the US. If this happens to you, it can generate a strong internal reaction. Descendents from inmigrants have to learn to live with and adjust to their multiple identities. In my experience it&amp;rsquo;s a gradient and I see it with friends that just arrived to the US from Mexico, people like myself who have been in the US for years, those who inmigrated to the US as children, and those who are descendants (2nd generation and beyond). Everyone is different and each one of us identifies with their cultural roots in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

She&amp;rsquo;s the one that shared the most detailed information of what happened through her &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17852314688598591/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Instagram stories&lt;/a&gt;.

If six years ago she decided to be part of a low resources project that aimed to build a Mexican Women&amp;rsquo;s softball team that could  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BWTHbfKjpBv/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;celeberate winning a match&lt;/a&gt;, participate in tournaments, win enough in the 2019 Pan Aamerican Games to classify to the Olympics for the first time ever, we have to thank her and value her effort, time, energy, and all that she dedicated towards making this dream a reality. Her participation at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was never guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

Regrettably they would end up losing the bronze medal match against the same team in Tokyo 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m now filled with sadness to see how the people in power are asking to get them suspended for life and/or take legal action against them because they threw away some uniforms with the Mexican flag (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/31912575/olympics-2021-mexico-softball-team-tosses-uniforms-olympic-village-trash&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;). They recognized that it was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I strongly think that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t their mistake only. It was a communication error from the administration if they didn&amp;rsquo;t explain to them the expectations that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they had to return all the equipment with them without any logistics or financial support to do so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bed covers were not a present like they thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the uniforms hold such a strong emotional value, even those that they didn&amp;rsquo;t actually use during the Olympics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration should have defended them and supported them instead of using them as a piñata and a distraction. Now part of the public is dedicated to attacking them just like Trump attacked/attacks Mexicans (whether they are American or not): that they aren&amp;rsquo;t Mexicans, that they should leave, that no one wants them, etc. Even some Olympic athletes, that have represented or represent Mexico, have an attitude of: if it was hard for me, it should be hard for you too. That&amp;rsquo;s the same attitude that I see in the academic realm that is used to make minorities suffer when they already have to fight with less resources for the opportunities others have. It&amp;rsquo;s an attitude of crushing each other instead of supporting each other so we can fix and learn from our mistakes and grow together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my open letter to Anissa Urtez and the rest of the Mexican Women&amp;rsquo;s softball team from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Anissa for representing us with pride and for all the countless hours of effort and sacrifice that you’ve dedicated to this sport and this team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Mexicans are humans and humans make mistakes. At a distance it’s clear to me that there was an error in communication and in setting expectations from the part of the administration. If the administration wasn’t going to support you to cover the additional baggage expenses, if they expected you to carry back all your uniforms and equipment, if they knew about the mattress cover, etc, they should have told you so. They should have tried to protect you and your teammates as much as possible and they completely failed you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You concentrated on performing well on your sport and what you know how to do better than anyone else in Mexico and among Mexican descendants in the US and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really sad that after all you did for representing Mexico now they are using you as a piñata. That others are attacking you on social media and staining your memories of Tokyo 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Mexican living in the US that spends part of his free time helping other Mexicans learn what I know how to do, I find it really emotional and motivating to read what it means to you to help guide the next generations in your sport where you are among the best in the world. Please keep it up! Hopefully this whole situation won’t discourage you and you’ll keep raising high the Mexican flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With support (well, hugs like we say in Mexico) from a random corner in the web in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a Mexican badass champion!!! 🇲🇽 💪🏽&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that Anissa and the team, as well as the future generations of the team, feels the same way that she felt not so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/authors/admin/avatar_hub730ffb954e879fe0ab174cacb839b41_1326712_270x270_fill_lanczos_center_2.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long start to 2020 including the past four very busy weeks, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that today March 16th 2020 I accepted a position as &lt;strong&gt;Research Scientist&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.libd.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lieber Institute for Brain Development&lt;/a&gt; in Baltimore, MD, USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/jRZXsVd7xbBAIF08eH&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;270&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/basketsfx-sign-autograph-there-jRZXsVd7xbBAIF08eH&#34;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-will-i-do-as-a-research-scientist-at-libd&#34;&gt;What will I do as a Research Scientist at LIBD?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At LIBD we currently have the following scientific ranks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Technician&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Assistant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Associate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staff Scientist I, II and III&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Scientist (+ Lead and Senior)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigator (+ Lead and Senior)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Scientists carry out research, do so scholarly, are tasked with being creative, are encouraged to seek funding, and can have supervisory and mentor roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my agreement with LIBD, I will remain affiliated with the Data Science Team I led by &lt;a href=&#34;http://aejaffe.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Andrew E Jaffe&lt;/a&gt; while also having the opportunity to interact with and collaborate with fantastic biologists, data scientists, and researchers at LIBD, Johns Hopkins University, and beyond. Furthermore, I will officially help mentor LIBD scientists in data science and R tools. LIBD will support me while I build a small team around my research interests and prepare my first set of grant submissions. There will be a transition period and many things I need to learn: from requesting a budget to writing a job ad, as well as many details about grant requests. But ultimately, LIBD offered me a launch pad for an academic career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/xiN0BXMETVsx0AxTXt&#34; width=&#34;315&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/usnationalarchives-night-nasa-xiN0BXMETVsx0AxTXt&#34;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my first tasks will be to refine the details of my role. For example, right now on the teaching side of things I&amp;rsquo;m imagining doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead a weekly &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LIBD rstats club&lt;/a&gt; meeting where I can go over topics common to several users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold one-on-one data science guidance sessions, similar to the MPH capstone sessions I did during my teaching assistant years at JHBSPH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally lead internal workshops, which could benefit from workshops I prepare for &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CDSB&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href=&#34;https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/#info&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;certified by RStudio&lt;/a&gt; and attend more R conferences &amp;amp; workshops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the scientific side, I will also learn more about the biological questions my LIBD colleagues are working on. These hypothesis-driven projects will provide me a new set of challenges and I will perform what me and my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lcg.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; classmates were trained to do: to function as a bridge between multiple fields. I will also keep learning from my JHU colleagues and working with them as I refine my ideas. Currently, this is how I have framed my research interests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research aims to better understand the roots and signatures of disease (particularly psychiatric disorders) by zooming in across dimensions of gene activity: from studying gene expression at all feature levels (genes to exons to exon-exon junctions and un-annotated regions of expression), to using different gene expression measurement technologies (bulk RNA-seq, single cell/nuclei RNA-seq to spatial transcriptomics) that provide finer biological resolution and localization of gene expression. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in both hypothesis-driven projects as well as building general resources such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;recount2&lt;/a&gt; that enable us to contextualize our findings across all of the public human gene expression landscape. I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R programming language&lt;/a&gt; for nearly all my work and like to organize my code in R packages that I share mostly through the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bioconductor project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for building my team, I know that overall one of the challenges everyone faces is recruiting talent. I&amp;rsquo;ll give this complicated process a shot by tapping into my network which includes many immigrants. I will also expand my network online and through conferences. Furthermore, I am committed to my outreach projects such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CDSB&lt;/a&gt; but will synergize them even more: re-use training materials, potentially recruit team members, and help me expand my network. In the meantime, if you are interested in working with me or my colleagues, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-decision&#34;&gt;Final decision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision I had to make was challenging, but in the end, I decided to stay at LIBD because they offered me a path to become a principal investigator in academia which it&amp;rsquo;s something I want to explore and see where it leads me. I will also formally be someone&amp;rsquo;s boss and gain managerial experience, work much closer with biologists in hypothesis-driven projects, and overall gain more experience and skills. My brother&amp;rsquo;s job tasks changed last week, to which I told him: &amp;ldquo;welcome to the real world&amp;rdquo;. Well, I guess that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;ll be for me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;acknowledgments&#34;&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone that helped me through this decision-making process, provided me with information, asked me questions, answered questions, expanded my universe, advocated for me, advised me, cheered for me, and supported me. Thank you! I look forward to working with you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning from our search history</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2020/02/12/learning-from-our-search-history/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2020/02/12/learning-from-our-search-history/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;origin-of-the-idea&#34;&gt;Origin of the idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently the team I work with has had a few new members and I’ve been thinking lately of ways we could try to help them. The team leader was traveling this week, which gave me the opportunity to come up with a new type of session and test it out. That’s the origin of this &lt;em&gt;learning from our search history&lt;/em&gt; idea. We tested it today and I’m quite happy with the results so far, so I thought it would be useful to document what we did and share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-theory&#34;&gt;The theory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I show in the slides below, in our group we follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/10/you-must-try-and-then-you-must-ask.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;you must try, and then you must ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; framework although with a little different interpretation. The basic goal is to search independently for a period of time (say 15 minutes), but then ask others for help if you are still stuck beyond that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async class=&#34;speakerdeck-embed&#34; data-id=&#34;a99280d748df4a88bf328e1bcaa8e95b&#34; data-ratio=&#34;1.29456384323641&#34; src=&#34;//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, you have to be able to find some answers yourself since that’s part of our job using resources that range from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Google Search&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bioconductor Support&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RStudio Community&lt;/a&gt;, among other websites. However, we also acknowledge that some questions have difficult answers. Maybe a Stack Overflow thread has multiple answers and not necessarily the top voted question has the answer you are looking for. So instead of spending too much energy, we also tell our members to avoid getting into a rabbit hole for hours. That’s where asking for help comes to play. And you can ask for help from any community you belong to: those involved in the project through Slack, our full team, other scientists in our university, communities we belong to like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&amp;amp;src=typed_query&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;rstats&lt;/em&gt; community on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the Bioconductor users community at large, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did mention that it’s ideal to think about the person who will be helping you answer your question. Small reproducible examples, versions of the software you used, sharing your code on GitHub &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the commands you used and the order you used them in can all be valuable for resolving different types of problems. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JennyBryan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jenny Bryan&lt;/a&gt; has talked much more about this subject, for example in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars/help-me-help-you-creating-reproducible-examples-jenny-bryan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2018 webinar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;in-practice&#34;&gt;In practice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying for a while then asking for help is all good in practice. However, &lt;strong&gt;asking for help is very challenging&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s scary, you open yourself because you show what you don’t know to other people, and sadly historically many questions have been met with negative feedback on the Internet. Thus, they can make you feel dumb, stupid and many other negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think that asking for help can be worth it and even wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/11/12/asking-for-help-is-challenging-but-is-typically-worth-it/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;previous blog post on this subject&lt;/a&gt;. Some reasons why it’s worth it include being able to move on with your work &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, you might learn something new, and if you follow the strategies for helping others help you, you might even figure out the answer yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we all ask for help regardless of how long we have been writing code. Here’s an example tweet that conveys the same message. There are thousands of such tweets online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I conduct approximately 3948234 programming-related Google searches per day. So does every other developer I know, whether they have 5 weeks of experience or 5 years. Help normalize this practice by tweeting your daily searches with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/devgoogle?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#devgoogle&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/XfNVUZlhC5&#34;&gt;https://t.co/XfNVUZlhC5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Lyzi Diamond (@lyzidiamond) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lyzidiamond/status/1085227527587561472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;January 15, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;we-are-diverse&#34;&gt;We are diverse&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/media/amy_mph.jpg&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team (shown as of May 2018) we work at is very diverse because we all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have different backgrounds,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have acquired different skills,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are at different career stages (from rotation student up to associate professor),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have different interests,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use different operating systems (from Fedora to Ubuntu to macOS to Windows)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use different tools (mobaxterm vs putty, TextMate vs RStudio, …).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also because we seek help in different ways &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and we learn differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we have a lot to learn from each other 😊🤓.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learn-from-each-other-exercise&#34;&gt;Learn from each other exercise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/learnfromsearch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;bit.ly/learnfromsearch&lt;/a&gt; you can find a copy of the Google Spreadsheet with the information you need for your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;some-rules&#34;&gt;Some rules&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to make sure that everyone will feel save to ask questions. That’s why I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reminded others about our code of conduct,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invited everyone to practice their empathy and be mindful that language matters &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to keep everyone’s time in their mind as a question could lead to a longer discussion which is best to take another occasion. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;main-steps&#34;&gt;Main steps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you pick a problem you solved recently and share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what you were trying to solve,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the actual text you searched for in Google or elsewhere &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the link of the website where you find your answer or that guided in this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We improved the steps as we were testing this!&lt;/em&gt; 🙌🏽🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everyone has contributed their information to the spreadsheet, we then proceed to go around the table showing and explaining our search use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the goals of this exercise are to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;empower ourselves with the knowledge from our teammates,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn from how we all find help,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build a supportive environment where we feel comfortable asking for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus in the end, we are enabling our team to fully follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/10/you-must-try-and-then-you-must-ask.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;you must try, and then you must ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-session&#34;&gt;Test session&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and only session so far went approximately like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 0-5: get settled in the room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 5-22: presentation about the idea to get members to buy into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 22-26: demonstration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 26-33: members prepared their information to share with the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 33-58: members presented their problems, the searches the did, and the solution(s) they found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min 58-60: quick wrap up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-search-example&#34;&gt;My search example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/learnfromsearch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;bit.ly/learnfromsearch&lt;/a&gt; I left some examples (anonymized). Mine was about increasing the point size of the output of a plot made with &lt;code&gt;scater::plotReducedDim()&lt;/code&gt; which returns a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Wickham_2016&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org&#39;&gt;Wickham, 2016&lt;/a&gt;) object. Hence why I searched in Google for &lt;code&gt;ggplot2 increase point size&lt;/code&gt; which lead me to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;geom_point()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reference website. I then tried using &lt;code&gt;+ geom_point(size = 20)&lt;/code&gt; but that broke the color mapping. I was about to dive into the GitHub code for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.17/scater&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;scater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-McCarthy_2017&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw777&#39;&gt;McCarthy, Campbell, Lun, and Willis, 2017&lt;/a&gt;) as this my go-to behavior for many similar quests, but I decided to check the help page using &lt;code&gt;?scater::plotReducedDim&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Additional arguments for visualization, see ?“scater-plot-args” for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation for &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; lead me to &lt;code&gt;?&amp;quot;scater-plot-args&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; where I finally found the &lt;code&gt;point_size&lt;/code&gt; argument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;point_size: Numeric scalar, specifying the size of the points. Defaults to NULL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that solved my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what used to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2020-02-12-learning-from-our-search-history_files/Screen%20Shot%202020-02-12%20at%209.55.09%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other examples involve different websites and showcase the diversity of questions we have as a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you like this idea and try it out yourselves. Maybe some of the lessons you learn trying it out could be useful to us as well. Ultimately, the information stored there could be useful for new team members as well as for current members since the spreadsheet becomes like an informal FAQ or team wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/MRwR1blxryNJm&#34; width=&#34;315&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was strongly encouraged by the feedback two members gave me individually after our trial session. Maybe this is not for everyone as we realized that it’s quite hard to be anonymous while participating &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This idea could evolve into something else, but at least for today, I’m happy with the amount of people that bought into the trial and participated in it. We’ll see what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can link to specific lines and see things you changed through time that might be the source of the problem are among the main reasons why you should try to version control your code.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially to a more interesting problem than the one you are stuck currently at.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, some use a particular project Slack channel, others the lab one, others through direct messages.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you say that something is obvious or easy, you are telling the other person that it should be easy for them too, but we know that it isn’t the case and that’s why they are asking a question.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to incorporate this exercise into our weekly meetings (maybe once a month), we need to make sure that our team meeting will finish on time.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of keywords can dramatically affect a search results, and this information is useful to convey among ourselves so we can learn to search for help more effectively.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, you can only be anonymous for those not in the room at the time the question was discussed.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10 months ago &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/04/19/latin-american-r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/#.XHiaE1NKg0o&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;we announced our plans&lt;/a&gt; to start a new community of R/Bioconductor developers in Mexico and Latin America. The National Bioinformatics Node (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nnb.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NNB-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; in Spanish) &lt;a href=&#34;http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;has organized workshops&lt;/a&gt; in bioinformatics and R since 2006 and more frequently since 2010. Last year, 2018, there were &lt;a href=&#34;http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/TIB2018/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;five simultaneous one week workshops&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to R and RStudio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of biological data with R&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EDA of RNA-seq data and differential expression studies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genome assembly and annotation from high-throughput sequencing data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And our &lt;a href=&#34;http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/TIB2018/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Latin American R/Bioconductor Developers Workshop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was a success as described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/post/a-recap-of-cdsb-2018-the-start-of-a-community/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A recap of CDSB 2018: the start of a community&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, we are not done yet! 💪🏽As we have stated several times, our goal is to turn R users into developers and to increase the representation of Mexicans and Latin Americans at other R events.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one R event that we followed as a guide last year is the Bioconductor yearly meeting, or &lt;em&gt;BioC&lt;/em&gt;. This year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioc2019.bioconductor.org/index&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BioC2019&lt;/a&gt; will be held during June 24 to 27 at New York City in the United States. If you are an academic the registration fee is 300 USD prior to May 24th. As of today (Feb 28th), a round trip from Mexico City on June 23 to 28th is about 320-410 USD&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioc2019.bioconductor.org/travel-accommodations&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;accommodation options listed&lt;/a&gt; start at 118 USD plus tax a night. As you can see, these numbers add up fairly fast which is a limiting factor for scientists from Mexico (and Latin American in general) to attend &lt;em&gt;BioC2019&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel-scholarships&#34;&gt;Travel scholarships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we want to remind you that there are travel scholarships available! And we, &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;CDSB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, want to help you! 🙌🏽&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the details about the travel scholarship and different types of submission proposals are available on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioc2019.bioconductor.org/call-for-abstracts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BioC2019&lt;/a&gt; website. But let us summarize the process for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to apply for either a &lt;strong&gt;talk&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;poster&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;workshop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need a professional website, GitHub profile or your CV to be available online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to answer two questions:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How have you participated in the Bioconductor project in the past?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you hope to get out of the conference?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a talk or poster proposal you have a maximum of 300 words while workshop proposals involve filling out a template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite a bit of work, but the payoff is immense! You will compete for the opportunity to travel basically for free: free registration and hotel, plus $500 for travel expenses. This can be a career changing opportunity as it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/lcolladotor/cdsbmexico&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the case for L. Collado-Torres (see his keynote slides)&lt;/a&gt; and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;get-started-on-your-scholarship-application&#34;&gt;Get started on your scholarship application!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that many of us have a tendency to do things at the last minute. However, we hope 🙏🏽
that you start your application materials as soon as you can. Remember that the deadline is &lt;strong&gt;March 15th&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;no exceptions&lt;/strong&gt; are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;website&#34;&gt;Website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a professional website, we recommend that you make one following &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Emily Zabor’s tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. This is the tutorial that one of your fellow CDSBMexico 2018 attendees used to create his website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://joseaia.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;joseaia.github.io&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/cbds-intro-r&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chromebook Data Science: intro to R course (available for free if you can’t afford it)&lt;/a&gt; which includes a lesson that walks you through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bioconductor-project-participation&#34;&gt;Bioconductor project participation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we know that each of you worked at least in one R package during CDSBMexico 2018 such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/post/r-gene-regulatory-interaction-formulator-for-inquiring-networks/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rGriffin (check the blog post)&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe you even submitted your package to Bioconductor. At least, you met and interacted with longtime Bioconductor members such as Martin Morgan and Benilton Carvalho. Since then, you might have worked on other R packages, shiny applications, etc. You might have also answered questions on the Bioconductor support website, reported bugs or opened issues in existing packages, joined the developers mailing list, joined the Bioconductor Slack workspace, etc. Ultimately, you could potentially present a poster or give a talk about the package you worked on last summer, but you’ll need to coordinate with your team members and/or lab principal investigator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;benefitting-from-bioc2019&#34;&gt;Benefitting from BioC2019&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what you hope to get out of the conference, well, we will remind you that BioC has different workshops that can help you advance your R skills and knowledge. Furthermore, there’ll be scientific talks from excellent bioinformatics researchers. Then, once you return from the conference, you can spread the knowledge you acquired in a variety of ways: implementing it on your work, teaching at your local university or research institute, participating in the Bioconductor community (Slack, the support website, contributing an R package, etc), presenting at a local R meetup, and participating in other forums. You can also benefit personally from attending the conference by networking with other users and developers that will attend it. From it, you might start new collaborations, find about graduate school programs, find potential postdoc advisors, among other opportunities. Hey, you might help us out with future CDSBMexico events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cdsbmexico-hands-on-help&#34;&gt;CDSBMexico hands on help&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need help directly, please get in touch with us via the CDSBMexico Slack workspace. If you either don’t remember the Slack workspace or you couldn’t attend CDSBMexico 2018, please get in touch with us via Twitter at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CDSBMexico&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;twitter.com/CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that not many will be able to attend BioC2019, so keep an eye open for CDSBMexico 2019! We are hoping to announce our plans soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The power of tapping into your community for support</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2019/02/03/the-power-of-tapping-into-your-community-for-support/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2019/02/03/the-power-of-tapping-into-your-community-for-support/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week the owner of my favorite Mexican restaurant in Baltimore, Rosalyn Vera, got death and arson&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; threats. I could have been a bystander, but I tapped into my network and asked for help and she has received it. It’s been great to see the power of the community in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-backstory&#34;&gt;The backstory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.bioconductor.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bioconductor&lt;/a&gt; for work and I get to witness the warmth and mostly friendly &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; community where daily people ask for help and get it. Born from the R community is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RLadies&lt;/a&gt; organization that provides a platform for non-cis gendered males to share their knowledge and increase their visibility. In one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies-baltimore.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RLadies Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; events, I met a Data Journalist from the Baltimore Sun, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/christinezhang&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Christine Zhang&lt;/a&gt; who gave an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_baltimore/blob/master/20181114_industry.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;excellent talk&lt;/a&gt; on how she uses R for her job: for example, election maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, I’m Mexican. To get over &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/11/mindfulness/#.XFdVC1xKiUk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my homesickness&lt;/a&gt; these past months I’ve been a frequent customer at a small Mexican restaurant in Baltimore called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cocinaluchadoras/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cocina Luchadoras&lt;/a&gt;. I also frequent live shows from a band called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/somebadhombres/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bad Hombres&lt;/a&gt; that plays covers of Spanish rock songs from the 80s and 90s, go to Latin karaoke nights organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/rootsraicesfest/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Root Raíces&lt;/a&gt;, among other things that bring me joy&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-threats-and-reactions&#34;&gt;Initial threats and reactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To warm up this week, I went to get some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=atole&amp;#43;de&amp;#43;arroz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;atole de arroz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at Cocina Luchadoras twice. The second time was just about an hour after Rosalyn received death and arson threats on Thursday. I could tell that she was scared but she was also incredibly brave. The threats were because she has placed a sign on her restaurant to support the &lt;em&gt;Donald&lt;/em&gt; fundraising campaign from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ilegalmezcal.com/donald/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ilegal Mezcal&lt;/a&gt; that says “Donald, eres un pendejo” (Donald, you are stupid) . The person making the threats mentioned that immigrants are taking away jobs from US citizens. As a Hispanic customer, I got scared as well and became suspicious of whoever entered the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does one do? How would you react to a hate crime threat? Or well, any threat? Call the police. Do you comply with the request to take down the poster? Hire security? Close and move to a different location? I feel like situations like this put can you at odds between following your ideals and being pragmatic. In this case, Rosalyn had to decide whether to stand by her free speech rights or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States of America you expect that the police and the institutions that protect the law will help you. Unlike Guatemala in the 1960s when the police/military tried to silence/kill my grandfather due to the health clinic he and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/07/30/harassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiration-from-my-grandmother/#.XFdafFxKiUk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my grandmother&lt;/a&gt; had where they would treat people from many backgrounds: he closed down, moved to Mexico, and had to be pragmatic and abandon some of his ideals. Or unlike Mexico in recent times, where there’s widespread insecurity due to the war on drugs, corruption, etc. For example, my father’s house was broken into, he got tied down and was punched until a few ribs broke: he called a Mexican military veteran for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here in the US, you call the police and wait for them to do their job. But you can also decide to ask for help from your community. So I offered Rosalyn my time and network, and she accepted. This was tricky as I told her, because I didn’t want to either give a platform for the person making the threats or to attract other people like him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Christine for help on whom to talk to at the Baltimore Sun, and she responded immediately. After some emails and knocking on a couple more doors, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-cocina-luchadoras-20190201-story.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Baltimore Sun published an article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LillianEReed&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lillian E Reed&lt;/a&gt; with contributions by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_ThaliaJuarez&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Thalia Juarez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cdrentz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Catherine Rentz&lt;/a&gt;. Catherine has published some great work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-two-years-of-hate-incidents-20180813-story.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hate crimes in Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and they’ve made an &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.baltimoresun.com/maryland-hate-crimes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;interactive map&lt;/a&gt; to browse the data. From there, the word kept spreading and many started to show their support: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/ame4se/man_allegedly_threatened_to_kill_baltimore/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Baltimore Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, local &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zeke_cohen/status/1091798436628832256&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt;, and many regular Cocina Luchadores customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-threats-continue&#34;&gt;The threats continue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went again on Saturday and the place was packed and things seemed to be trending on the right direction. The police had called and were supposed to meet with Rosalyn later. Instead, they didn’t show up and the person making the threats called again…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an allocation of limited resources, I understand that the Baltimore Police has many things to do and many people to keep safe. Catherine Rentz’ &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-two-years-of-hate-incidents-20180813-story.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on hate crimes in Maryland from 2016 and 2017 highlights that this type of crime is likely underreported and that there are very few convictions. Maybe this went through the mind of the policeman who did the report on Thursday: “threat phone call? No witnesses? Ok, not enough evidence… move on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a very hard time processing the no-show by the police though. Talking to others, we discussed how the law enforcement system is overworked (they are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wmar2news.com/homepage-showcase/baltimore-police-to-switch-to-new-patrol-schedule&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reducing the police officer shift length&lt;/a&gt; soon) and swamped. But hey, there’s a supportive community. So I asked for help again. “Who knows someone at the Baltimore Police?” That was the question and soon enough one friend replied, and then emailed a lieutenant. By the next morning (Sunday/today), the Baltimore Police chief was looking to call Rosalyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we let the Baltimore Sun know that the person had made the threat again. They quickly posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-threat-over-anti-trump-poster-spurs-business-20190202-story.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;new story&lt;/a&gt; where they report how Rosalyn first made sure to secure more witnesses this time and secondly told the person making the threats that she has only love for him and thanked him for the phone call. I think that she was really smart with both and she does mean it. In a chat with friends, one of them suggested bringing tacos as a peace offering to the person making the threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second story by the Baltimore Sun got shared by Newsweek in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newsweek.com/restaurant-owner-allegedly-receives-death-threats-over-anti-trump-banner-1315971&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;own story&lt;/a&gt;. A friend who is in Mexico right now told me he saw it on the top Apple News stories. Today, there was a security guard at Cocina Luchadoras, who smiled and opened the door for anyone coming in. So spreading the word, asking for help, knocking on doors, and the power of the community is very strong. Strong enough to get the police to pay more attention to Rosalyn’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is incredible! Typically, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RLadies&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#RLadies&lt;/a&gt; request for help ends up with a friendly reply pointing to an existing R package or a suggestion on what to do. This time, we gamed the system. So yes, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/11/12/asking-for-help-is-challenging-but-is-typically-worth-it/#.XFdT41xKiUk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;asking for help is challenging but can be worth it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And surely everyone who’s involved in helping in this story can use it to request the help they need. For example, the Baltimore Sun’s hate crime reporting team can ask for more space and resources for their stories. Or the Baltimore and Maryland Police can ask for help from whoever controls their budget&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so they can get more resources to fight the increase in hate crimes, improve the reporting of hate crime threats, and reach out ot the Hispanic community in Baltimore. If they need a letter of support, they can get one from me if they want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, it’s a chance to try to live without fear. Fear is a powerful feeling and I’ve seen it in action. I experienced it first hand when everyone I knew stopped going out in Cuernavaca during an intense period of the war on drugs when military were deployed to the streets. It’s also a chance for us Hispanics in Baltimore to feel like we belong here, which is the same challenge many women and non-cis males have and hence the reason why &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RLadies&lt;/a&gt; is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;and-drop-by-to-enjoy-the-awesome-food-and-women-art&#34;&gt;And drop by to enjoy the awesome food and women art!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you drop by in Baltimore, you should go visit Cocina Luchadoras! Their food is deliciously awesome. It starts with handmade tortillas. You use tortillas for many things including tacos. A good tortilla can boost the flavor in a taco, and the ones at Cocina Luchadoras are outstanding! Then there’s the filling which can range from pork (&lt;em&gt;al pastor&lt;/em&gt;) to different types of vegetables. And while you wait, you get to experience a women’s empowerment museum with all the arts and crafts they have there about how women are really strong! You also get to meet many interesting patrons and make new friends if you wish to do so. Even if you are not in Baltimore, you should follow them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cocinaluchadoras/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/cocinaluchadoras/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for great art and food pictures (or &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobile.twitter.com/cocinaluchadora&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but they don’t post images there, just links to Instagram).&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/11/06/a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many times I’ve started to write this post in my mind since May 2018. Today I’m finally typing it on the computer. This will be a rather long post that ties in several threads. I’ll talk about Cold Spring Harbor’s Biology of Genomes conference and its relationship to my undergrad in Mexico. I’ll also introduce you to Aldo Barrientos (1987-2011) who was was my undergrad classmate. Then I’ll tell you about myself and how regardless of your situation, privileged or not, you should ask for help and get to know the people around you. Finally, I want to highlight that many other Mexican researchers are doing great work and would love to be invited to talk about their work. Or simply, the opportunity to compete for scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cshl-and-lcg-unam&#34;&gt;CSHL and LCG-UNAM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past May I was selected to give a talk at &lt;a href=&#34;http://meetings.cshl.edu/Genome18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Biology of Genomes 2018&lt;/a&gt; (BOG) at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cshl.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (CSHL). This was my first time being there and I had plenty of time to reflect before my talk&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For me, attending BOG was like a dream come true so I was blown away when I was selected to present at BOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard about the BOG conference when I was studying my undergrad in Mexico at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/es/about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;. My class has a history with the conference too. Basically, part of the class was meeting to discuss what optional courses to create for our fourth year, and well, some miscommunication happened among us. This created a rift in the group and was one of my motivations for focusing on communication as well as giving back. The former lead to me being elected as class president and the latter lead to me volunteering to teach R courses later on my undergrad&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As BOG18 went underway, some of my fellow junior presenters started their talks by mentioning why CSHL was special to them. Following their cue, I wrote some notes just before my presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/2018-11-06%2021.21.51.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to give a shoutout to all my LCG-UNAM classmates. I also thought of Aldo Barrientos and how it could have been him at BOG. This got me nervous, but I really wanted to do it. I also wanted this to be short and professional. You can see how it turned out for yourself&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRGkibDQgIc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aldo-barrientos&#34;&gt;Aldo Barrientos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time for me to tell you more about Aldo Barrientos, my LCG-UNAM classmate. I won’t attempt to tell you his whole story since I think that others could write a much more detailed one that myself. I hope they do and if they are made public, I’ll share them from this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldo came from a low income family in Mexico: I believe that his father was a construction worker&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. He was smart and advanced through school successfully. He took the entry exam for LCG-UNAM like many people did in 2005. Eventually only around 10-15 percent of the applicants were admitted to this undergrad program. The school was free (25 Mexican cents per year), but it involved relocating to a new city. UNAM has some scholarship programs, but they are not enough. Aldo found a way like he always did. For example, he sold candy and juice to his classmates during lunch break. For reasons that I don’t remember, Aldo didn’t complete his undergrad in 2009 but was about to in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember Aldo as a very joyful person who was always smiling and joking with the rest of us. He had the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; dancing skills of anyone at my undergrad. He proved them time and time again, for example winning a dance contest at a party in my house and wearing the Pumas UNAM puma costume in our graduation party and dancing with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/goyo.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sk.pinterest.com/pin/170714642102216698/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His path was cut abruptly in 2011. He was stabbed multiple times while waiting for someone. We all knew about this. It’s still unclear to me how everything happened in the following months. But I remember being told that he tried seeing a doctor before going back to his home. One day in 2011, we all started to learn about how grave his situation had turned. I didn’t know what to do&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I talked to David Romero, director (dean?) of CCG-UNAM back then. He guided me and others and we were trying to coordinate ways to help Aldo, but by the time we got to his home it was too late. I regret that we weren’t able to help Aldo earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have some emails from 2011 when we were talking about doing something to honour him. We never did as a class, though LCG-UNAM did acknowledge him. Maybe one day we will do an event to remember him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldo faced more challenges that myself and other classmates. Yet I believe that he would have kept solving them one by one; he would have gotten his undergrad degree and had he chosen to stay in academia, then present his research findings at conferences like BOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;privileged-yes-entitled-no&#34;&gt;Privileged yes, entitled no&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about Aldo made reflect also on who has been around in my own path, who has helped me and how grateful I am to them. Undoubtedly I’ve had an easier path than others including Aldo. That is, I’ve been privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even with my privileged position it has been a hard fought battle to get to where I am now. I think that a mistake others do is that they assume that they are entitled to something given their privilege instead of working for that thing. This can apply to visas and the like where you still &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/19/problems-with-an-article-from-the-baltimore-sun-covering-dr-mahoney-steel-s-immigration-issues/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;have to apply for them in time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along my way I have hesitated many times what to do and have sought guidance from others. Also along my way, I’ve tried to get to know others in my surroundings. Now that I look back I realize that many people were at my position or in junior positions have kept working towards their career goals and advanced in them. So, if you can, get to know others and learn from them. They could be the future Full Professors with Tenure, future Senior Software Engineers or other titles you look up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an incomplete version of my timeline (&lt;a href=&#34;https://lcolladotor.github.io/misc/timeline.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF version&lt;/a&gt;). I think that it’s pretty hard to list everyone who has helped you along the way. For example, I’m not mentioning my Ph.D. classmates from whom I learned many things. But it will give you a more detailed picture of the amount of people that have helped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said at the beginning of my BOG18 talk, I’m not sure if I’m the first LCG-UNAM alumni to present at BOG but I know for sure that I won’t be the last one. That’s because I’m really proud of my classmates and all the great work they are doing. It’s also easy to go beyond my class to other LCG-UNAM alumni and then even go beyond and extend this to Mexican researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which then lead to my current career.

&lt;p&gt;My scientific talk was about the BrainSeq Phase II project by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.libd.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lieber Institute for Brain Development&lt;/a&gt;. It’s now available as a bioRxiv pre-print: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/26/426213&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;426213&lt;/a&gt;. It took a while to finish this project, which contributed to my delay in making this blog post.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of my post incorrectly said that he was a farmer.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that others asked me since I was or had been the class representative.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What about a lawyer-like app as the minimum help for defendants in immigration cases?</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/17/what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/17/what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I attended the special panel discussion event at JHSPH called &lt;a href=&#34;http://hopkinshumanitarianhealth.org/news-events/events/separated-child-separation-at-the-border-a-health-and-human-rights-perspect&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“Separated: Children Separation at the Border A Health and Human Rights Perspective”&lt;/a&gt;. It got my mind racing and here’s an idea. It’s likely (definitely) incomplete, but maybe it’ll get others to think on related ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-17-what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases_files/ChildSepBorder.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;panel-summary&#34;&gt;Panel summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel was composed by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ColleenKraft&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Colleen Kraft&lt;/a&gt;, President, American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EricSchwartzRI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eric Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;, President, Refugee International&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Escobar, Chief of Program and Services, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wearecasa.org/who-we-are/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CASA de Maryland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pbspiegel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Paul Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;, Director, Center for Humanitarian Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed the first 30 minutes or so but I still got to listen to most of it. The panel members presented many facts and here are some that will be relevant to the idea I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child separation is just one of the consequences of the current’s administration immigration policies implemented and enforced by the Department of Justice (ultimately headed by Jeff Sessions, the US Attorney General).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US is the only country (to the panel’s members knowledge) with a child separation policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to empathy many individuals across political lines reacted against child separation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US immigration system won’t really change much even if Democrats get elected. Obama did deport over 2 million individuals, though he prioritized &lt;em&gt;criminals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrested immigrants are not required by law to have representation (a lawyer) provided by the government&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minors (say 3 year old children) with no lawyers are being highlighted in the media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration cases where the defendants have lawyers drastically improve&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the odds for the defendants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges are human.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges typically used to (or maybe still do) try to give time for a minor to get a lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges are &lt;em&gt;alledgely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; being pressured to meet quotas in the range of 700 to 1,000 cases by year under the current administration. Thus judges sometimes have to close cases in a couple of hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration judges now basically have 2 options for closing a case: order deportation or (I’m missing the correct term) &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; the defendant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end the panel members highlighted that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; should take some type of action&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but that we should consider the consequences of our suggested policy changes. They also mentioned that we should take advantage of this moment (child separation got everyone’s attention) to raise the profile of the other problems with the current immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-way-of-taking-action-heres-an-idea&#34;&gt;My way of taking action: here’s an idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m by no means an immigration expert. My way of taking action is to share ideas, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2017/01/25/An-alternative-to-the-Mexico-US-wall-where-the-US-would-gain-millions-of-dollars/#.W6BV4v5Kg0o&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;I’ve done in the past&lt;/a&gt;, that might be incomplete, unrealistic or even super flawed, but that hopefully motivate others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bare bones version of my idea was: what if immigrants could have an &lt;em&gt;automatic&lt;/em&gt; (programmed) lawyer and translator during their hearings? This would not be a replacement for actually having lawyers (say those provided by local governments or NGOs as George Escobar mentioned) but would raise the minimum bar for those immigrants who currently have their cases processed with no lawyers at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-into-the-details&#34;&gt;Getting into the details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that we could get our hands on dozens/hundreds/thousands? of transcripts of immigration court hearings where we have the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the judge said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the government’s lawyer said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the defendant’s lawyer said (either to the judge or to the defendant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the defendant said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like a script for a play. We would additionally need a table with court hearing metadata such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome: deportation, being &lt;em&gt;freed&lt;/em&gt; (term?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date of the hearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State where the hearing occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then using machine learning (maybe with deep learning methods) process the text and try to determine potential suggestions an actual defendant’s lawyer would give to its defendant or respond to the judge/government’s lawyer. It might not always get things right, but I imagine that it would be better than the current state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automatic lawyer would need then to work as say a phone app that listens to what others are saying in the room. Say have 3 icons with one per person present (judge, defendant, gov’s lawyer). Then the defendant presses each button when each person is talking. The app then shows some 1 to say 3 suggested responses (with translations)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and responds for the defendant in English once the defendant chooses an option (or goes with the top one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implementing-an-initial-version-of-the-app&#34;&gt;Implementing an initial version of the app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that large computing companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google would be willing to provide some compute credits on their clouds for the initial version of the algorithm that is &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to the court hearing and then provides suggestions. Think of this as the “suggested text” you get nowadays when typing emails on Gmail or text messages. Maybe these companies have programs where you can apply to have some of their engineers help you for a certain number of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that one big initial challenge would be to get that collection of transcripts from immigration court hearings where defendant lawyer(s) were present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that automated lawyers are not allowed currently in courts. But compared to providing human lawyers in all immigration cases, this change might be more &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; to pass as a law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that some phone companies might be willing to provide some refurbished phones that only have this app installed and are kept safe in the immigration courts. And well, satisfy any security requirements the government has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improving-the-app&#34;&gt;Improving the app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets say that you get that alpha version of the app working. If we had volunteer lawyers annotate the transcripts with some information about the intent behind what each person said (it could start with just 3 options: negative, positive, neutral from the perspective of the defendant) that could maybe help the algorithm that processes the transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we also had more detailed court hearing metadata such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location of the court (I imagine a that a few judges work in each court)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demographics of the defendants: like which country or even region of the country where they come from, whether the defendant has any family support, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Category information for the court hearing (maybe cases can be grouped into a few categories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I imagine that the app would be able to have more personalized experience, like re-adjust the suggestions based on which court you are located at and adapt the translations to the Spanish version the defendant is most familiar with (we say &lt;em&gt;buddy&lt;/em&gt; in so many different ways as shown below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-09-17-what-about-a-lawyer-like-app-as-the-mininum-help-for-defandants-in-immigration-cases_files/bromap.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pictoline/photos/a.1611821172410355.1073741828.1598399590419180/1623937737865365/?type=1&amp;amp;fref=nf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app could also be connected to remote human immigration lawyers than can intervene remotely when the suggestions algorithm doensn’t know what to do. Maybe this could be part of some social service that immigration lawyers (regardless of their personal political preferences) could do as some elective during their formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;doing-some-convincing&#34;&gt;Doing some convincing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that you could try to get support for this automatic immigration lawyer by arguing that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s better than no lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s cheaper than having lawyers for all cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves processing times on average (ideally) such that immigration judges can fulfill their quotas (here I’m hoping that it reduces the rate at which cases are closed with deportation orders).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is more humane than having a minor with no help. Though I hope that immigration judges would still try to give time for children to secure a lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might be implemented earlier (years earlier?) than changes in immigration law requiring that all defendants have a human lawyer in immigration cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If human lawyers can help through the app, then it also increases the number of jobs for immigration lawyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea has potentially many flaws because like any system, people on both sides will try to game it. This is where having a large set of transcripts would be useful as well as continuous updates to the algorithm such that gaming the system actually becomes hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this is just an idea, or a collection of them around one theme. It would need serious work to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Escobar mentioned that they protested the fact that a DUI labeled someone as a criminal, but well, Trump has gone beyond DUIs arrested many individuals with no criminal history.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Escobar highlighted that one path of action is to convince local governments to fund/provide lawyers to these individuals.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know by how much.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information has leaked about this but I guess that it’s not completely public info.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could be with your vote, helping members in your community that are affected, improving how we translate research into terms everyone understands, improving the education about the violent reality many are trying to escape by coming to the US, approaching local governments, etc.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app could show the text but also should &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the translations since very young children will very likely not know how to read. I think that the app should never assume that the defendant knows how to read.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Harassment, diversity in science and inspiration from my grandmother</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/07/30/harassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiration-from-my-grandmother/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/07/30/harassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiration-from-my-grandmother/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a big day. I care about many things including diversity in science (STEM) and building a community of R users and developers in Mexico. Both moved forward in two completely separate conferences: one in Mexico: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=jsm2018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt;; and one in Canada: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=jsm2018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cdsbmexico&#34;&gt;CDSBMexico&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very important day for me. It was the beginning of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/post/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018&lt;/a&gt; in Cuernavaca, Mexico. I already wrote a blog post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/04/19/latin-american-r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/#.W1-lhNhKi50&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;why I was super excited about CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt;, but briefly it’s because this is something we’ve been wanting to see become a reality for years and have been working towards it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Here are my slides for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CDSBMexico?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt; remote talk tomorrow for day 1 of the &amp;quot;Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018&amp;quot;. 70 slides for ~20 min, I can do this! 💪🏾 Right &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jtleek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@jtleek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Shannon_E_Ellis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@Shannon_E_Ellis&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/xKh2214YbM&#34;&gt;https://t.co/xKh2214YbM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/teaching?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#teaching&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Bioconductor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@Bioconductor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CDSBMexico?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/SULAoPbHeZ&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/SULAoPbHeZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Leonardo Collado-Torres (@lcolladotor) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1023665229882961922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 29, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My job was to give the first keynote to pump up everyone at the workshop. So I had a bit of trouble sleeping and woke up remembering a dream. If you know me, I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; dream: or never remember my dreams. It was a dream of my grandmother Mercedes Vides Tovar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-07-30-harrassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiraton-from-my-grandmother_files/2018-07-30%2018.15.38.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;grandma&#34;&gt;Grandma&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many things from my grandparents in me, like Juan’s joviality, Rosa’s love, Rolando’s tenacity to overcome tough moments. Or so I like to think. But my grandma, &lt;em&gt;Abue&lt;/em&gt;, has always been an academic inspiration. She overcame many challenges in her life. She studied at the university to become a doctor, even without total family support (to avoid details). She was a trailblazer in the field of Epidemiology. She had to flee her native country leaving everything behind. She studied at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pasteur.fr/en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Institut Pasteur&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, France while caring for 3 adolescents as a single mom. She studied in a time when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=womeninstem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WomenInSTEM&lt;/a&gt; had to disguise themselves up as men and were the targets of jokes all the time. Rolando, her classmate at the university, has told me a handful of these &lt;em&gt;jokes&lt;/em&gt;: I wouldn’t be the only one to call many of them harassment. She left academia to start her own business in public health. She was the main health supervisor in the first international conference my dad organized early in his career (which helped him launch it): I was the 6 year old in charge of delivering the gifts in the closing ceremony ^^. She would answer my phone calls when I first started French school and my dad was busy at work: thanks to their time in Paris my dad fell in love with the French way of teaching math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-07-30-harrassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiraton-from-my-grandmother_files/2018-07-30%2018.41.52.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually don’t know much more. She passed away when I was 13 after a years long battle with disease. Google tells me that she is a co-author of at least three titles in the field of Public Health:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1968 &lt;a href=&#34;http://saludpublica.mx/index.php/spm/article/download/3327/3212&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Organización del servicio social de los pasantes de Odontología en México&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1970 &lt;a href=&#34;http://saludpublica.mx/index.php/spm/article/viewFile/2346/2234&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Situación epidemiológica de la frontera norte de México y programa de vigilancia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1972 &lt;a href=&#34;http://saludpublica.mx/index.php/spm/article/download/1874/1822&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Proyecto de organización y funcionamiento de los laboratorios de salud pública en los estados de la frontera norte&lt;/a&gt;: also, she’s the sole author.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-07-30-harrassment-diversity-in-science-and-inspiraton-from-my-grandmother_files/2018-07-30%2017.22.57.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did inherit her souvenirs from her trips (my dad also loves them) and something that is precious to me: a medal with her name. I’ve looked at that medal next to my bed in Mexico many times. I would look at it, search for inspiration, then try harder to solve whatever academic problem I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my dream there was a moment where I was sitting next to her (me in my current adult form) and we were revising many of our shared moments. She was explaining to me things she couldn’t explain before because I wouldn’t have understood them. She also pumped me up before my day and wished me luck for my talk. I think that I delivered ^^&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;womeninstem&#34;&gt;WomenInStem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a big day for &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=womeninstem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WomenInSTEM&lt;/a&gt; and in particular in the field of Statistics. Why? Today the Joint Statistical Meetings (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=jsm2018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;) held a session on “Addressing Sexual Misconduct in Statistics” that was organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/stephaniehicks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stephanie Hicks&lt;/a&gt; and chaired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/keegankorthauer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Keegan Korthauer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;For &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;, I organized a session on Addressing Sexual Misconduct in Statistics. If you plan to attend the meeting, I invite you to join us &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/UxpUiqPzTy&#34;&gt;https://t.co/UxpUiqPzTy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/IdShEPlqi6&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IdShEPlqi6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Stephanie Hicks (@stephaniehicks.bsky.social) (@stephaniehicks) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/stephaniehicks/status/1004467110918213637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session is not a direct response (I think) but it’s definitely related to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KLdivergence&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kristian Lum&lt;/a&gt;’s blog post titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kristianlum/statistics-we-have-a-problem-304638dc5de5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Statistics, we have a problem&lt;/a&gt; and to the more general &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=metoo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MeToo&lt;/a&gt; movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual harassment and misconduct not a US problem only. We have a code of conduct at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CDSBMexico&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt; both in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ComunidadBioInfo/R-BioConductor-Developers-Workshop-2018/blob/master/R-Bioconductor-2018_Program.rmd#code-of-conduct&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/codigo-de-conducta/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; to help prevent any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Q by me: what to do when people outside the U.S. say that this is an American problem and they don&amp;#39;t need to have a code of conduct for their meeting? &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Michael Hoffman @michaelhoffman.bsky.social (@michaelhoffman) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman/status/1024060403138142209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be there, but I wasn’t the only one excited following what has happening online thanks to tweets from many including &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mandyfmejia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mandy Mejia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael Hoffman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. Now in CC-West Ballroom A. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#JSM2018&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/Pw9zdlhi02&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Pw9zdlhi02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mandy Mejia, PhD (@mandyfmejia) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mandyfmejia/status/1024042337033285632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;times-are-changing&#34;&gt;Times are changing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think that slowly, maybe sometimes quickly, the times are changing. I’ve been telling friends and family for a few years now that I’ve come to realize that we need to keep trying to improve, to stay updated, to do what’s best and maybe sometimes come up with new ideas to improve things. I do care quite a bit for &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=womeninstem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WomenInSTEM&lt;/a&gt; but for me, it’s larger than that. It’s about diversity. I don’t know in how many different ways we can label each other and it’s not the point. So yes, gender diversity is a good thing and initiatives like this seem like a good thing to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Looks like a good thing to do. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/m2sjLYB1Er&#34;&gt;https://t.co/m2sjLYB1Er&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ashg18?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#ashg18&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/iKofjrIKTx&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/iKofjrIKTx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Leonardo Collado-Torres (@lcolladotor) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1024068383564853248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I think immediately of next steps, like race and ethnicity as well as sexual diversity. I want to ask for more, but I sometimes hold myself back. I’m no expert on many of these topics, so maybe what seems like a good policy could easily backfire later. So I think about incremental steps. But maybe that’s too slow and not enough. Maybe careers are suffering but I guess that as a community we are going as safely and fast as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;This 💯! My career trajectory would have been completely different in absence of hostile environments. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/aqmQtVyXUW&#34;&gt;https://t.co/aqmQtVyXUW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dr. Elana J Fertig (@FertigLab) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FertigLab/status/1024044326664527875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not supporting whoever Michael was referencing in his next tweet. I don’t flirt at conferences: I do socialize and try to make new friends with fellow conference attendees. I do acknowledge that I struggle in my head with what is ok and not ok to do, particularly with people you spend at lot of time with at school, work, etc. I’m not certain of the boundary between clumsy dating skills and sexual misconduct in some scenarios. I think that I’m not the only one because I’ve heard different versions in different sexual harassment prevention sessions. So mostly I end up doing nothing yet sometimes I wonder if I lost out because I didn’t try a bit more with X person. For instance, Mercedes maried her classmate Rolando. What can I say, I’m still learning and we all probably need to learn to differentiate these boundaries better through more training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;We ran out of time so we didn&amp;#39;t get to hear the question from the dude who was saying that something (I presume flirting at conferences) was &amp;quot;human nature&amp;quot;. Our loss, I&amp;#39;m sure &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Michael Hoffman @michaelhoffman.bsky.social (@michaelhoffman) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman/status/1024066415752433664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also know that sometimes I’ve been a bystander and failed to take action. So this next idea sounds good to me. I do try to intervene more now, specially with micro aggressions: because they are less high pressure situations and easier to do something about, at least that’s how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Bystander training might help. It&amp;#39;s not easy to do the right thing in a difficult situation when you have no idea what the right thing is, no training, no experience, no practice. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#JSM2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Michael Hoffman @michaelhoffman.bsky.social (@michaelhoffman) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman/status/1024063008987787264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
