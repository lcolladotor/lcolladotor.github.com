      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2023/04/16/czi-lat-am-meeting-2023-some-questions-i-have-before-the-meeting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited for the opportunity to participate at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CZILatAmMtg&amp;amp;src=typed_query&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#CZILatAmMtg&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cziscience&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CZI Science&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m also thankful to those who nominated me, and in particular to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AleMedinaRivera&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alejandra Medina Rivera&lt;/a&gt;. I believe that one of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;m here is for my volunteer work at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico (CDSB), where &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/#people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; have made very important contributions. Some also know me from my time in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bioconductor Community Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt;, from which I stepped down earlier this year once my 3 year term ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I have been sharing with some other event attendees that I do feel burned out. I had envisioned that at CDSB we would train and empower those who would eventually replace us. And we&amp;rsquo;ve had quite a bit of success in doing so (3/7 CDSB board members are not founders). However, it&amp;rsquo;s been limited to a few key new volunteers, who then they risk burning out themselves. Since I want CDSB to continue on for many more years to come, I sometimes feel like I should again involve myself on organizing CDSB events. Doing so would involve volunteering on my free time. Given my position as a principal investigator, I actually spend more extra hours on activities related to that job, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much free time to give. There are also other non-academic interests I want to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I want to chat with others that organize short courses through their own organizations to learn how they plan to pass on the torch and see if those ideas can apply to CDSB as well as renew my own fire. Maybe others don&amp;rsquo;t plan to pass on the torch for many years as organizing these short courses becomes part of their main job. At CDSB (and LCG-UNAM) courses, I like the path of having students in year 1, that become teaching assistants in year 2, that then teach a portion of the course in year 3, then can organize part of or a full course in year 4. But that&amp;rsquo;s a long ramp, and I think that I failed to anticipate what would happen after year 4. Like there needs to be more structure to help them continue this cycle and reach a point where they can apply for grants without the names of the founders. I also failed to notice that founders would need to be involved for a longer period of time, until we reach a larger critical mass of highly trained volunteers, which at time point can fully replace us and keep CDSB going for more years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I also have other questions and topics I want to discuss with others. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m really curious to learn about justifications others use to convince their employers to let them spend work time on these type of initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some arguments I&amp;rsquo;ve used are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are training the future staff we want to recruit. I learned this from a former &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sacnas.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SACNAS&lt;/a&gt; president and it was useful to argue for time to teach (in my case in Mexico) without having to take vacations time to do so for a week or two per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is one I used recently in the context of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LIBD rstats club&lt;/a&gt; I organize at work: &amp;ldquo;YouTube analytics tell me that we&amp;rsquo;ve had 4,621 views in the last 365 days for a total watch time of 280.7 hours. That&amp;rsquo;s an average of 5.4 hours per week, which is 13.5% of a 40 hour work week that we saved a full time employee on average per week this last year. For example, for a base salary of $x$ or $y$ that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;gt;10,000 or &amp;gt;20,000 USD in savings per year taking into account fringe costs. These videos remain in perpetuity, and while some might become outdated, they are definitely an asset for the institute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also curious to hear what arguments others use to convince their employers to let them apply to grants that limit indirect costs. For example, US-based institutions depend on those indirect costs to function, and will not like it if you apply for a grant that will limit your effort available for other grants if that grant provides, let&amp;rsquo;s say, less than 25% or 50% of the indirect costs other grants provide. Direct costs are like research costs and salary support for your team. Like if you are doing so well that you get funding for 100% of your effort, then of course institutions would like it for you to have the max indirect costs rate possible. Though well, a grant with a lower indirect costs rate is better than no grant if you don&amp;rsquo;t have 100% funded effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe something funding bodies could do is request that a small portion of the grantees time is used to teach communities in need for these opportunities (here we are talking about Latin America, but it could be other ones). Another idea is that they could reward with a higher indirect cost rate those institutions that allow grantees to do this during work hours. These ideas might have no legs, but maybe they could. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While change takes a lot of effort and sometimes one might feel alone, I am definitely excited about the discussions we&amp;rsquo;ll have the next two days. Though I&amp;rsquo;m also aware of potential pitfalls, like fighting for a piece of the cake. Hopefully we can make the cake bigger!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conference feelings: from newbie to sponsor</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2020/02/03/conference-feelings-from-newbie-to-sponsor/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2020/02/03/conference-feelings-from-newbie-to-sponsor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2008, nearly 12 years ago, I attended my first R/Bioconductor conference: &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2008/BioC2008/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BioC2008&lt;/a&gt;. Just last week I went to my second &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/conference/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rstudio::conf(2020)&lt;/a&gt; which I greatly enjoyed. After some &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1224512627017244673?s=20&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tweets exchanges today&lt;/a&gt;, I started reflecting on my journey and wanted to share my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-i-like-going-to-conferences&#34;&gt;Why I like going to conferences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typically enjoy going to conferences, though I also end up exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/l3V0p1WFoSIrzPLW0&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/l3V0p1WFoSIrzPLW0&#34;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of it could be the traveling and all that goes with it, but I think that conferences are mostly mentally taxing. There’s an information deluge which I typically find overwhelming. Sure, I love finding about new work but at some point it’s like collecting bookmarks of stuff to read or try out later &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Yet the most exhausting component of going to a conference could be the networking aspect. Meeting others and catching up with friends is &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; rewarding which is why I ultimately sign up for the next conference. How rewarding can it be? My most extreme example is when two professors invited me to apply to the Ph.D. program that I ended up studying. Though simply making friends and having friendly faces around you can go a long way. I’ll expand a bit on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;as-a-newbie&#34;&gt;As a newbie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across my career I have felt as a &lt;em&gt;newbie&lt;/em&gt; when attending many different conferences. I might be alone or maybe have a friend at the conference, or it could be my first time at a conference that I haven’t been to. Your mind, like mine, can be filled up with questions that later might seem simple like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should I dress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it ok to drink alcohol? &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I not feel alone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I the odd one here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I talk to X or Y person I’ve heard about before but never met?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answers have likely changed over time and currently are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable, but remember that this is a work event. So look professional by getting a haircut and dressing up a bit &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, but not too much and if I don’t want any, that’s ok too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to whoever seems friendly: could be someone new or an old friend or acquaintance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe, but &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; 🤷🏽‍♂️. I do try talking to other latinos or foreigners specially when there’s not many of us around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This one is still hard, but maybe someone I know knows them and can introduce me. If so, I ask for the favor. Otherwise I try to approach them with a question about their work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;as-a-sponsor&#34;&gt;As a… &lt;em&gt;sponsor&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to avoid feeling alone is something that can still shape my behavior at a conference. If possible, I like having some close friends I can hang out with and be relaxed, almost as if we were not at the conference. They provide a zone that I can enter, recharge, and then head out of it again to continue networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet recently, I’ve grown more conscious of the fact that I’ve been around longer than others. Meaning that I might be the person that knows X or Y that they want to meet or talk to. That is, I find myself more frequently in the position of introducing people and helping them make connections. Somehow asking X or Y: “hey, do you have a minute? Can I introduce you to someone?” is way less scary even if I’m not the closest acquaintance of X or Y. That is, becoming a &lt;em&gt;sponsor&lt;/em&gt;: mostly the &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; portion as defined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://hookedondata.org/the-importance-of-sponsorship/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this blog post by Emily Robinson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I still network like I used to, a portion of my time is spent checking on others I know so they are not alone and helping them when possible make the connections they want. Doing so also helps me strengthen my own connections as I detailed near the end of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1224034242537119744?s=20&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tweet series post-rstudio::conf(2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstudioconf?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstudioconf&lt;/a&gt; + I also asked &amp;amp; appreciated their advise! Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m just trying to emulate what others have done for me in the past (too many to list, thank youuu!), as I know that getting someone to answer the doorbell is the first step towards opening a door🤗🙌🏾&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; 11/11&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Leonardo Collado-Torres (@lcolladotor) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1224034315429994502?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;February 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feeling-empowered&#34;&gt;Feeling empowered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching out and trying to meet someone is hard and scary. Something that helped me since BioC2008 was the fact that I had others in mind: I knew that I was going to teach R later that fall at LCG-UNAM, so any questions I could get through or people I could meet were huge wins for me. Thus, thinking about others empowered me to network. And that’s still true for me through our CDSB project at &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;comunidadbioinfo.github.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m still feeling shy or alone, I remember a story from my dad: he claims that without approaching others who were having dinner at a table, introducing himself and creating a social connection, his ideas would have not made the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9278503&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; genome paper&lt;/a&gt; that helped launch his career. Personally, once I break that barrier and start to feel comfortable, I feel like I can ask anything: specially feedback and support from others on how to advance some ideas of mine. Lately, that’s mostly been related to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CDSB&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish others could feel empowered too, yet it’s hard to get there. For now, I simply try to help others emulating what others have done for me. Ultimately, I know that getting someone to answer the doorbell is the first step towards opening a door 🤗🙌🏾 which motivates me and helps me overcome my shyness. Whatever they do after someone answers the doorbell is up to the person I’m helping. Yet in that moment, the satisfaction of helping others make connections fulfills me. Later on, it brings a smile to my face even if I’m exhausted after the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why I have recently taken to Twitter to take “notes”. Notes that I make public and not necessarily go back and revisit, but if I want to, I know where they are.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or not drink alcohol. Whichever you want.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10 months ago &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/04/19/latin-american-r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/#.XHiaE1NKg0o&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;we announced our plans&lt;/a&gt; to start a new community of R/Bioconductor developers in Mexico and Latin America. The National Bioinformatics Node (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nnb.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NNB-UNAM&lt;/a&gt; in Spanish) &lt;a href=&#34;http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;has organized workshops&lt;/a&gt; in bioinformatics and R since 2006 and more frequently since 2010. Last year, 2018, there were &lt;a href=&#34;http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/TIB2018/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;five simultaneous one week workshops&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to R and RStudio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of biological data with R&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EDA of RNA-seq data and differential expression studies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genome assembly and annotation from high-throughput sequencing data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And our &lt;a href=&#34;http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/TIB2018/r-bioconductor-developers-workshop-2018/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Latin American R/Bioconductor Developers Workshop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was a success as described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/post/a-recap-of-cdsb-2018-the-start-of-a-community/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A recap of CDSB 2018: the start of a community&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, we are not done yet! 💪🏽As we have stated several times, our goal is to turn R users into developers and to increase the representation of Mexicans and Latin Americans at other R events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bioc2019&#34;&gt;BioC2019&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one R event that we followed as a guide last year is the Bioconductor yearly meeting, or &lt;em&gt;BioC&lt;/em&gt;. This year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioc2019.bioconductor.org/index&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BioC2019&lt;/a&gt; will be held during June 24 to 27 at New York City in the United States. If you are an academic the registration fee is 300 USD prior to May 24th. As of today (Feb 28th), a round trip from Mexico City on June 23 to 28th is about 320-410 USD&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioc2019.bioconductor.org/travel-accommodations&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;accommodation options listed&lt;/a&gt; start at 118 USD plus tax a night. As you can see, these numbers add up fairly fast which is a limiting factor for scientists from Mexico (and Latin American in general) to attend &lt;em&gt;BioC2019&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel-scholarships&#34;&gt;Travel scholarships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we want to remind you that there are travel scholarships available! And we, &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;CDSB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, want to help you! 🙌🏽&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the details about the travel scholarship and different types of submission proposals are available on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioc2019.bioconductor.org/call-for-abstracts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BioC2019&lt;/a&gt; website. But let us summarize the process for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to apply for either a &lt;strong&gt;talk&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;poster&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;workshop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need a professional website, GitHub profile or your CV to be available online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to answer two questions:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How have you participated in the Bioconductor project in the past?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you hope to get out of the conference?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a talk or poster proposal you have a maximum of 300 words while workshop proposals involve filling out a template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite a bit of work, but the payoff is immense! You will compete for the opportunity to travel basically for free: free registration and hotel, plus $500 for travel expenses. This can be a career changing opportunity as it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/lcolladotor/cdsbmexico&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the case for L. Collado-Torres (see his keynote slides)&lt;/a&gt; and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;get-started-on-your-scholarship-application&#34;&gt;Get started on your scholarship application!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that many of us have a tendency to do things at the last minute. However, we hope 🙏🏽
that you start your application materials as soon as you can. Remember that the deadline is &lt;strong&gt;March 15th&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;no exceptions&lt;/strong&gt; are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;website&#34;&gt;Website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a professional website, we recommend that you make one following &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Emily Zabor’s tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. This is the tutorial that one of your fellow CDSBMexico 2018 attendees used to create his website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://joseaia.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;joseaia.github.io&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/cbds-intro-r&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chromebook Data Science: intro to R course (available for free if you can’t afford it)&lt;/a&gt; which includes a lesson that walks you through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bioconductor-project-participation&#34;&gt;Bioconductor project participation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we know that each of you worked at least in one R package during CDSBMexico 2018 such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/post/r-gene-regulatory-interaction-formulator-for-inquiring-networks/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rGriffin (check the blog post)&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe you even submitted your package to Bioconductor. At least, you met and interacted with longtime Bioconductor members such as Martin Morgan and Benilton Carvalho. Since then, you might have worked on other R packages, shiny applications, etc. You might have also answered questions on the Bioconductor support website, reported bugs or opened issues in existing packages, joined the developers mailing list, joined the Bioconductor Slack workspace, etc. Ultimately, you could potentially present a poster or give a talk about the package you worked on last summer, but you’ll need to coordinate with your team members and/or lab principal investigator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;benefitting-from-bioc2019&#34;&gt;Benefitting from BioC2019&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what you hope to get out of the conference, well, we will remind you that BioC has different workshops that can help you advance your R skills and knowledge. Furthermore, there’ll be scientific talks from excellent bioinformatics researchers. Then, once you return from the conference, you can spread the knowledge you acquired in a variety of ways: implementing it on your work, teaching at your local university or research institute, participating in the Bioconductor community (Slack, the support website, contributing an R package, etc), presenting at a local R meetup, and participating in other forums. You can also benefit personally from attending the conference by networking with other users and developers that will attend it. From it, you might start new collaborations, find about graduate school programs, find potential postdoc advisors, among other opportunities. Hey, you might help us out with future CDSBMexico events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cdsbmexico-hands-on-help&#34;&gt;CDSBMexico hands on help&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need help directly, please get in touch with us via the CDSBMexico Slack workspace. If you either don’t remember the Slack workspace or you couldn’t attend CDSBMexico 2018, please get in touch with us via Twitter at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CDSBMexico&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;twitter.com/CDSBMexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that not many will be able to attend BioC2019, so keep an eye open for CDSBMexico 2019! We are hoping to announce our plans soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/11/06/a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many times I’ve started to write this post in my mind since May 2018. Today I’m finally typing it on the computer. This will be a rather long post that ties in several threads. I’ll talk about Cold Spring Harbor’s Biology of Genomes conference and its relationship to my undergrad in Mexico. I’ll also introduce you to Aldo Barrientos (1987-2011) who was was my undergrad classmate. Then I’ll tell you about myself and how regardless of your situation, privileged or not, you should ask for help and get to know the people around you. Finally, I want to highlight that many other Mexican researchers are doing great work and would love to be invited to talk about their work. Or simply, the opportunity to compete for scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cshl-and-lcg-unam&#34;&gt;CSHL and LCG-UNAM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past May I was selected to give a talk at &lt;a href=&#34;http://meetings.cshl.edu/Genome18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Biology of Genomes 2018&lt;/a&gt; (BOG) at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cshl.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (CSHL). This was my first time being there and I had plenty of time to reflect before my talk&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For me, attending BOG was like a dream come true so I was blown away when I was selected to present at BOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard about the BOG conference when I was studying my undergrad in Mexico at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lcg.unam.mx/es/about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LCG-UNAM&lt;/a&gt;. My class has a history with the conference too. Basically, part of the class was meeting to discuss what optional courses to create for our fourth year, and well, some miscommunication happened among us. This created a rift in the group and was one of my motivations for focusing on communication as well as giving back. The former lead to me being elected as class president and the latter lead to me volunteering to teach R courses later on my undergrad&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As BOG18 went underway, some of my fellow junior presenters started their talks by mentioning why CSHL was special to them. Following their cue, I wrote some notes just before my presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/2018-11-06%2021.21.51.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to give a shoutout to all my LCG-UNAM classmates. I also thought of Aldo Barrientos and how it could have been him at BOG. This got me nervous, but I really wanted to do it. I also wanted this to be short and professional. You can see how it turned out for yourself&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRGkibDQgIc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aldo-barrientos&#34;&gt;Aldo Barrientos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time for me to tell you more about Aldo Barrientos, my LCG-UNAM classmate. I won’t attempt to tell you his whole story since I think that others could write a much more detailed one that myself. I hope they do and if they are made public, I’ll share them from this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldo came from a low income family in Mexico: I believe that his father was a construction worker&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. He was smart and advanced through school successfully. He took the entry exam for LCG-UNAM like many people did in 2005. Eventually only around 10-15 percent of the applicants were admitted to this undergrad program. The school was free (25 Mexican cents per year), but it involved relocating to a new city. UNAM has some scholarship programs, but they are not enough. Aldo found a way like he always did. For example, he sold candy and juice to his classmates during lunch break. For reasons that I don’t remember, Aldo didn’t complete his undergrad in 2009 but was about to in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember Aldo as a very joyful person who was always smiling and joking with the rest of us. He had the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; dancing skills of anyone at my undergrad. He proved them time and time again, for example winning a dance contest at a party in my house and wearing the Pumas UNAM puma costume in our graduation party and dancing with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-11-06-a-knot-of-threads-from-cshl-to-lcg-unam-to-aldo-barrientos-to-diversity-scholarship-opportunities_files/goyo.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sk.pinterest.com/pin/170714642102216698/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His path was cut abruptly in 2011. He was stabbed multiple times while waiting for someone. We all knew about this. It’s still unclear to me how everything happened in the following months. But I remember being told that he tried seeing a doctor before going back to his home. One day in 2011, we all started to learn about how grave his situation had turned. I didn’t know what to do&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I talked to David Romero, director (dean?) of CCG-UNAM back then. He guided me and others and we were trying to coordinate ways to help Aldo, but by the time we got to his home it was too late. I regret that we weren’t able to help Aldo earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have some emails from 2011 when we were talking about doing something to honour him. We never did as a class, though LCG-UNAM did acknowledge him. Maybe one day we will do an event to remember him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldo faced more challenges that myself and other classmates. Yet I believe that he would have kept solving them one by one; he would have gotten his undergrad degree and had he chosen to stay in academia, then present his research findings at conferences like BOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;privileged-yes-entitled-no&#34;&gt;Privileged yes, entitled no&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about Aldo made reflect also on who has been around in my own path, who has helped me and how grateful I am to them. Undoubtedly I’ve had an easier path than others including Aldo. That is, I’ve been privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even with my privileged position it has been a hard fought battle to get to where I am now. I think that a mistake others do is that they assume that they are entitled to something given their privilege instead of working for that thing. This can apply to visas and the like where you still &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/09/19/problems-with-an-article-from-the-baltimore-sun-covering-dr-mahoney-steel-s-immigration-issues/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;have to apply for them in time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along my way I have hesitated many times what to do and have sought guidance from others. Also along my way, I’ve tried to get to know others in my surroundings. Now that I look back I realize that many people were at my position or in junior positions have kept working towards their career goals and advanced in them. So, if you can, get to know others and learn from them. They could be the future Full Professors with Tenure, future Senior Software Engineers or other titles you look up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an incomplete version of my timeline (&lt;a href=&#34;https://lcolladotor.github.io/misc/timeline.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF version&lt;/a&gt;). I think that it’s pretty hard to list everyone who has helped you along the way. For example, I’m not mentioning my Ph.D. classmates from whom I learned many things. But it will give you a more detailed picture of the amount of people that have helped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said at the beginning of my BOG18 talk, I’m not sure if I’m the first LCG-UNAM alumni to present at BOG but I know for sure that I won’t be the last one. That’s because I’m really proud of my classmates and all the great work they are doing. It’s also easy to go beyond my class to other LCG-UNAM alumni and then even go beyond and extend this to Mexican researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine was the very last one of the conference.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which then lead to my current career. See more at my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1023665229882961922&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt; for the “Latin American R/BioConductor Developers Workshop 2018”.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My scientific talk was about the BrainSeq Phase II project by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.libd.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lieber Institute for Brain Development&lt;/a&gt;. It’s now available as a bioRxiv pre-print: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/26/426213&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;426213&lt;/a&gt;. It took a while to finish this project, which contributed to my delay in making this blog post.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of my post incorrectly said that he was a farmer.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that others asked me since I was or had been the class representative.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steps for writing a Twitter summary conference blog post</title>
      <link>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/10/23/steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/10/23/steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote several blog posts with many tweets&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as a way of taking notes during the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ashg.org/2018meeting/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;American Society of Human Genetics 2018 conference&lt;/a&gt;. A few friends asked me how I did this &lt;em&gt;so fast&lt;/em&gt;. The process can be summarized into the following main steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save links of tweets you want to highlight in your post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-powered blog to obtain the code for embedding tweets easily&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proofread, edit and post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-steps-detailed&#34;&gt;My steps detailed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the actual process I used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify the conference Twitter hashtag. In my recent case, that was &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ASHG18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASHG18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a Google doc or some other simple text file you can access easily from your phone and laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in a presentation, check the &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt; tweets for the given hashtag. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;vertical=default&amp;amp;q=%23ASHG18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASGH18 example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the link of any tweet you find interesting. If there are none for the session you are in, consider writing some tweets yourself with the conference hashtag!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.12.23%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste the link into your Google doc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.10.53%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the day is over, copy-paste the contents of your Google doc into a text editor that has the ability to find and replace using regular expressions. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://macromates.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.15.18%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find and replace to create the syntax for embedding tweets. I’ll cover more of this in detail in the next section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34; data-lang=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;twitter.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;.*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and replace by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34; data-lang=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;\n`r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;shortcode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;tweet&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.17.03%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34; data-lang=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;[0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and replace by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34; data-lang=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;)`\n&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.17.58%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our file now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.18.07%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add any comments you wish, format the headings and proofread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it public and tweet about your post with the conference hashtag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you are done! 🙌🏽🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quick-embedding&#34;&gt;Quick embedding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that my blog is powered by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a id=&#39;cite-Xie_2017&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#39;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#39;&gt;Xie, Hill, and Thomas, 2017&lt;/a&gt;) which has the function &lt;code&gt;blogdown::shortcode()&lt;/code&gt; for embedding tweets. For example, &lt;code&gt;blogdown::shortcode(&amp;quot;tweet&amp;quot;, user=&amp;quot;lcolladotor&amp;quot;, id=&amp;quot;1054380320533950464&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; generates the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; syntax code which then &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; renders into the tweet itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I just completed my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ASHG18?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#ASHG18&lt;/a&gt; survey &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GeneticsSociety?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@GeneticsSociety&lt;/a&gt;. Took a few minutes and most of my feedback wouldn&amp;#39;t stand out. Except that I did use a box to suggest having a webinar with role playing scenarios that exemplify how the code of conduct can be used to diffuse harassment &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jsdron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@jsdron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/AKZdnGCr25&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/AKZdnGCr25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Leonardo Collado-Torres (@lcolladotor) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1054380320533950464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;October 22, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, we can use Twitter itself by copy-pasting the code for embedding the tweet directly from the Twitter app/website. On the top right side menu on the tweet itself, select &lt;em&gt;Embed Tweet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.04.03%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then copy-paste the HTML code into your post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-10-23-steps-for-writing-a-twitter-summary-conference-blog-post_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-23%20at%2011.04.28%20PM.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;quot;twitter-tweet&amp;quot; data-lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot; dir=&amp;quot;ltr&amp;quot;&amp;gt;I just completed my &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ASHG18?src=hash&amp;amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;quot;&amp;gt;#ASHG18&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; survey &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/GeneticsSociety?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;quot;&amp;gt;@GeneticsSociety&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Took a few minutes and most of my feedback wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t stand out. Except that I did use a box to suggest having a webinar with role playing scenarios that exemplify how the code of conduct can be used to diffuse harassment &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jsdron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;quot;&amp;gt;@jsdron&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://t.co/AKZdnGCr25&amp;quot;&amp;gt;pic.twitter.com/AKZdnGCr25&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;mdash; 🇲🇽 Dr. Leonardo Collado-Torres (@fellgernon) &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/lcolladotor/status/1054380320533950464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;quot;&amp;gt;October 22, 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script async src=&amp;quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and here is how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be other ways of doing this that are specific to your blog platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that it should be possible to &lt;em&gt;bookmark&lt;/em&gt; the tweets on Twitter and then use an R package to extract your bookmarked tweets from the past 24 hours in order to simplify the process. Maybe this can be done with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rtweet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rtweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; although I haven’t dived into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-to-blogdown&#34;&gt;New to &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, ask around. You might belong to a group or know someone that is willing to host a guest post in their &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; blog. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/10/16/ashg18-tweet-summary-day-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ashg.org/2018meeting/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2018 conference&lt;/a&gt;. The official hashtag for the conference is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ASHG18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASHG18&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. At first I was tweeting myself and checking both the &lt;em&gt;top&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt; tweets. As the day progressed I started a Google Doc to take notes during talks. I was missing some details so I was relying on the &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt; tweets and copy-pasting the tweet links to my notes. At some point I told myself I should simply turn this collection of tweet links into a simple blog post. So here it is for day 1. You can consider it a curated list of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ASHG18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASHG18&lt;/a&gt; tweets. Although it’s incomplete because it only covers the talks I went to starting from the Presidential address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linked tweets are frequently from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thatdnaguy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eli Robertson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael Hoffmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but also from other Twitter users&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli Robertson creates great Twitter threads, so I frequently only link to the first tweet of the thread.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Hoffmann also writes multiple tweets per talk, though you’ll have to scroll through his timeline to find all the ones related to a talk. Unless I’m missing a way to make them into a thread.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some with a few followers, some with many. It didn’t matter. I was just checking the &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt; and saving the ones I liked the most.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
