	abstract = {Relative cell type fraction estimates in bulk RNA-sequencing data are important to control for cell composition differences across heterogenous tissue samples. While there exist algorithms to estimate the cell type proportions in tissues, a major challenge is the algorithms can show reduced performance if using tissues that have varying cell sizes, such as in brain tissue. In this way, without adjusting for differences in cell sizes, computational algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, rather than the relative fraction of cell types, leading to potentially biased estimates in cellular composition. Furthermore, these tools were built on different frameworks with non-uniform input data formats while addressing different types of systematic errors or unwanted bias.},
