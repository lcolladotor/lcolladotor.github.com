	abstract = {Bisulfite sequencing is a powerful tool for profiling genomic methylation, an epigenetic modification critical in the understanding of cancer, psychiatric disorders, and many other conditions. Raw data generated by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) requires several computational steps before it is ready for statistical analysis, and particular care is required to process data in a timely and memory-efficient manner. Alignment to a reference genome is one of the most computationally demanding steps in a WGBS workflow, taking several hours or even days with commonly used WGBS-specific alignment software. This naturally motivates the creation of computational workflows that can utilize GPU-based alignment software to greatly speed up the bottleneck step. In addition, WGBS produces raw data that is large and often unwieldy; a lack of memory-efficient representation of data by existing pipelines renders WGBS impractical or impossible to many researchers.},
