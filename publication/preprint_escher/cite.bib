	abstract = {The creation of effective visualizations is a fundamental component of data analysis. In biomedical research, new challenges are emerging to visualize multi-dimensional data in a 2D space, but current data visualization tools have limited capabilities. To address this problem, we leverage Gestalt principles to improve the design and interpretability of multi-dimensional data in 2D data visualizations, layering aesthetics to display multiple variables. The proposed visualization can be applied to spatially-resolved transcriptomics data, but also broadly to data visualized in 2D space, such as embedding visualizations. We provide an open source R package escheR, which is built off of the state-of-the-art ggplot2 visualization framework and can be seamlessly integrated into genomics toolboxes and workflows.Availability and implementation The open source R package escheR is freely available on Bioconductor (bioconductor.org/packages/escheR).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.PCAprincipal component analysist-SNEt-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingUMAPuniform manifold approximation and projectionscRNA-seqsingle-cell RNA-sequencingsnRNA-seqsingle-nucleus RNA-sequencingSRTspatially-resolved transcriptomicsEFNA5membrane-bound ligand ephrin A5EPHA5ephrin type-A receptor 5DLPFCdorsolateral prefrontal cortex},
