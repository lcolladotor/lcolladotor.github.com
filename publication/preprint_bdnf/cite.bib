	abstract = {Divergent transcription from bidirectional promoters is frequently observed in eukaryotic genomes, but the biological relevance of divergent RNA transcripts (DT) is unknown. We identified and characterized BDNF-DT, a novel DT gene, and BDNF-AS-DT, a novel readthrough gene, in the locus containing BDNF, a gene with key roles in neuronal development, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. BDNF-DT is independent from the known BDNF antisense (BDNF-AS), and its expression is developmentally regulated and positively correlated with BDNF in human postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). BDNF-DT and BDNF-AS-DT expression increase after induced depolarization, but the temporal dynamics follow expression of BDNF, suggesting a regulatory role. Moreover, CRISPR-mediated upregulation of BDNF in human neural progenitor cells drives BDNF-DT expression. Finally, BDNF-DT shows higher expression in DLPFC from patients diagnosed with schizophrenia compared to neurotypical controls, and genetically predicted lower expression of the BDNF-AS-DT readthrough transcript is associated with schizophrenia and with the schizophrenia-associated C allele of the rs6265 single-nucleotide polymorphism. These data suggest that BDNF-DT and BDNF-AS-DT contribute to BDNF regulation and schizophrenia risk.},
