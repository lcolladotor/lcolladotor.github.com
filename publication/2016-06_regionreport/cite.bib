	abstract = {regionReport is an R package for generating detailed interactive reports from region-level genomic analyses as well as feature-level RNA-seq. The report includes quality-control checks, an overview of the results, an interactive table of the genomic regions or features of interest and reproducibility information. regionReport provides specialised reports for exploring DESeq2, edgeR, or derfinder differential expression analyses results. regionReport is also flexible and can easily be expanded with report templates for other analysis pipelines.},
