	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with sexually dimorphic features, including differential symptomatology, drug responsiveness, and male incidence rate. To date, only the prefrontal cortex has been examined in large-scale transcriptome analyses for sex differences in schizophrenia. Here, we examined the BrainSeq Consortium RNA-sequencing and genotypes for the caudate nucleus (n=399), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; n=377), and hippocampus (n=394) to characterize sex differences in schizophrenia. We identified genomic features (genes, transcripts, exons, and exon-exon junctions) associated with sex, sex-specific expression in schizophrenia, and sex-interacting expression quantitative trait loci (si-eQTL) associated with schizophrenia risk. We found 878 unique genes with sex differences across brain regions, including ANK3, which shows male-biased expression in the caudate nucleus. X-chromosome dosage was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of female and male individuals with schizophrenia. Our sex interaction model revealed 15 novel junctions dysregulated for schizophrenia in a sex-specific manner. Sex-specific schizophrenia analysis identified dozens of expressed, sex-specific features with enrichment in the transcriptional response of cellular stress. Finally, our si-eQTL analysis revealed 974 unique genes, 14 of which are associated with schizophrenia risk. Overall, our results increased the number of annotated sex-biased features, identified sex-specific schizophrenia genes, and provided the first annotation of si-eQTL in the human DLPFC and hippocampus. Altogether, these results point to the importance of sex-informed analysis of sexually dimorphic traits and inform personalized therapeutic strategies in schizophrenia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported by the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) T32 fellowship (T32MH015330) and K99 award (K99MD016964) to KJMB, NIH R01 (R01MH123183) to LC-T, and a NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from the Brain \&amp; Behavior Research Foundation to JAE.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The research described herein complies with all relevant ethical regulations.
